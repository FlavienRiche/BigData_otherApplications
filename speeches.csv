Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
1,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
2,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

4,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
5,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

7,,"November 15, 2023","Hello everyone. I’m glad to be marking the second anniversary of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law with new Treasury Department analysis showing the tremendous impact of the Biden Administration’s investments in infrastructure. Public infrastructure investment is essential to economic growth. According to one analysis, a 10 percent increase in public capital investments in core physical infrastructure increases productivity by more than 2 percent. And due in large part to this productivity increase, public investments in infrastructure grow national output, by as much as 1.2 percent in the long run for every 10 percent increase in public capital investment.Yet U.S. infrastructure investment has fallen sharply in recent decades. It declined as a share of the economy in 42 states between 2009 and 2021, including during the early days of the recovery from the pandemic.Two years ago, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law changed that. Treasury’s new analysis shows that the two-year increase in state and local capital investment as a share of GDP is the largest since 1979. The Biden Administration has announced nearly $400 billion in funding, including over 40,000 projects and awards. Americans are seeing the changes in their own communities. Bridges are being repaired. Roads are being paved. Airports are being improved. These investments are boosting our country’s economic strength and resilience for the long haul. And they’re also broadening economic opportunity for people and places that have historically been left behind. It’s gratifying that we’re seeing this in the data just two years after the BIL was passed. Investments are creating well-paying construction jobs, many of them union jobs that don’t require a college degree. And Treasury’s new analysis shows that funding is going where it’s needed most across the country, not just to the coasts or to wealthy communities. States with the lowest-rated public infrastructure are receiving more than twice as much funding per capita as states with the highest-rated infrastructure. And funding is tending to land in states with lower median household incomes. This is the reverse of the typical pattern, which is that higher-income states invest more in infrastructure.Funding is also being more broadly distributed. Take spending on public transit—crucial for both equity and addressing climate change, since less-wealthy Americans are more likely to rely on public transit, and reliable public transit encourages everyone to reduce gasoline use. In 2019, only five states accounted for about two-thirds of all investment in public transit. Our analysis shows that those five states accounted for only about 40 percent of BIL funding. Ten states are receiving BIL transit funding that, per capita, is more than ten times their pre-pandemic annual transit investment. An additional ten states are receiving five times as much. And 18 other states are receiving two times as much. The BIL, along with the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, exemplify the President’s and my belief that America’s economic strength is derived from our middle class, and that we should seek to grow our economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not the top down. This is at the core of the President’s economic strategy—what we call Bidenomics. And it also aligns with what I’ve called modern supply-side economics, increasing our long-term productive capacity while broadening economic opportunity across the country and addressing challenges like climate change.Our legislation is having a transformational impact. Alongside the impacts I’ve highlighted today, real manufacturing construction has doubled since the end of 2021, and private sector investments in key sectors like electric vehicle manufacturing are reaching communities that have been too often overlooked. I am hopeful about the long-term economic momentum in the U.S. economy, and I believe our Administration’s economic plan will keep us on the right track. Thank you for joining today."
8,,"November 13, 2023","Thank you to Lieutenant Governor Kounalakis for your remarks and introduction. And to Dominic for your remarks and leadership. To all ABAC delegates: Thank you for your hard work to make the United States’ host year a success, and welcome to San Francisco. This evening, I’ll discuss the importance of the Asia-Pacific region, APEC’s evolving mission, and the absolutely vital role of the private sector in advancing APEC’s work.Over the past few decades, the Asia-Pacific region has steadily increased in importance for the global economy. The region is a key driver of global innovation, opportunity, and growth. And its economic importance is only poised to increase. We all recognize this, and the Biden-Harris Administration has made engaging with the region a key strategic priority. The United States’ economic approach has included deepening our regional economic ties, with tremendous potential benefits for the U.S. economy and for APEC economies. I’ve personally visited six APEC members in the past two years. I’ve seen firsthand their economic dynamism and promise, and I’ve engaged with authorities, citizens, and the private sector to deepen the United States’ ties.The United States is also deeply committed to APEC itself. 30 years ago, we convened the first APEC Leaders’ Meeting on Blake Island in the state of Washington, and leaders first outlined APEC’s vision of economic cooperation to promote shared prosperity. Since, APEC members have reaffirmed and updated that mission, most recently in the 2020 Putrajaya Vision, where we recommitted ourselves to our shared vision of an open, dynamic, resilient, and peaceful Asia-Pacific community.30 years after Blake Island, this year’s APEC Economic Leaders’ Week is an opportunity for us to accelerate progress toward this shared vision. Today, during the Finance Ministers’ Meeting, my fellow ministers and I discussed the significant strides we’re making to unlock more growth and dynamism across the region. We focused on our three finance track themes: the responsible development of digital assets; support for effective energy transitions and sustainable finance; and economic policies to enable stronger growth while supporting inclusion and environmental sustainability. Across each theme, we recognized engagement with the private sector was key. Indeed, one of APEC’s core strengths is that it not only recognizes the integral role the private sector plays in achieving our mission; it fully integrates the private sector in its work. ABAC, through its formal role in APEC, connects authorities with private sector actors to share viewpoints and find ways to advance our common goals. I especially appreciate ABAC’s focus on equity and sustainability, themes that align closely with this year’s finance track priorities. As I discussed with ministers earlier today, reducing inequality is key to unlocking the untapped potential of our economies. And the post-pandemic recovery offers APEC members a critical opportunity to drive inclusive growth. Doing so will not only improve the lives of our citizens; more inclusive economies are also stronger and more resilient. For example, we must continue to look for ways to enable women’s participation in the workforce—to fuel their full participation in society and to unlock a critical source of economic dynamism. The private sector has a key role to play here.Sustainability is another focus for both APEC Finance Ministers and ABAC. Many APEC economies are highly vulnerable to climate change.  Given the interconnectedness of our economies and our shared vision of the future, we have no choice but to join together to address this challenge and to realize the opportunities of the transition to net zero. In today’s meeting, Finance Ministers discussed the need for continued efforts to support just energy transitions and explored how to strengthen mechanisms that enable carbon reduction across our economies, including voluntary carbon markets. And we focused on promoting climate-aligned financing approaches to harness private sector investment.As leaders in the private sector, ABAC members are a critical partner in these initiatives. And looking across the private sector more broadly, I am heartened by the increasing numbers of firms working to increase equity and address climate change, among many other shared priorities.With that, thank you again to all of you for your work to advance APEC’s vision. It’s been a productive host year for the United States, and we look forward to continued strong partnership with the private sector to drive much more progress in the years to come."
9,,"November 13, 2023","I’ve been very glad to chair the 2023 Finance Ministers’ Meeting here in San Francisco over the past two days. And the United States has been proud to host APEC throughout this year. Hosting APEC is one of the many ways the Biden Administration is broadening and deepening our economic ties across Asia-Pacific economies. APEC economies are at the center of the global economy and our world’s economic future. The United States’ engagement with other APEC economies strengthens the U.S. economy, benefits American workers and firms, and advances American interests. It’s bringing significant benefits to the region as well. And cooperation across APEC economies is also key to tackling the challenges we all face, including the urgent threat of climate change.Over the past year, APEC members have advanced our shared vision of an open, dynamic, resilient, and peaceful Asia-Pacific region through finance track engagements. And today’s Finance Ministers’ Meeting allowed us to cement progress on key priorities: from monitoring macroeconomic and financial developments in the region and globally, to advancing our approaches to regulation of digital assets, sustainable finance, and inclusive growth-oriented policies consistent with what I’ve called modern supply-side economics. I’ll start there. APEC members have affirmed a shared interest in pursuing policies that expand the productive capacity of our economies while also achieving outcomes like reducing inequality and protecting the environment. In the United States, we’re doing this through a historic trifecta of legislation: President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. I’m very pleased that other APEC economies recognize the potential of this strategy and are pursuing similar policies, including ones that support research and development, invest in infrastructure, and drive labor force participation. We’ve also aligned on the importance of addressing global challenges. Our joint work centers on unlocking the flow of sustainable finance, including through exploring ways to drive the development of credible climate commitments and to create effective and high integrity voluntary carbon markets. We also agree that engagement with the private sector is critical, as is engagement with international financial institutions. The Biden Administration’s efforts to accelerate the transition to a net-zero economy range from our launch of the Principles for Net-Zero Financing and Investment, to our call to evolve the multilateral development banks, to our support for the transition to clean energy in economies including Indonesia and Vietnam through Just Energy Transition Partnerships. Our discussions have revealed the ways other APEC members are also pursuing meaningful work.There is also commitment to continued work on the responsible development of digital assets, where many APEC economies are leading the way. We see increasing adoption of digital asset technologies across the region and note their potential to increase financial inclusion and reduce the cost of cross-border transactions. We also recognize that digital asset technologies carry risks, however, and appreciate the need for proper regulation and other policies to manage those risks. Of course, chairing the APEC Finance Ministers’ Meeting is only one aspect of the United States’ much broader commitment to deepening our engagement across the Asia-Pacific region. As one example, Treasury is actively engaged in the ongoing work to reach a substantial conclusion of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. This would be a monumental achievement for IPEF members, addressing issues from climate change to supply chain security. And since IPEF members collectively account for 40 percent of global GDP, it would be significant for the global economy as well.  Responsibly managing the U.S.-China economic relationship has also been a key priority throughout my time in San Francisco. As you know, I met with Vice Premier He Lifeng, my Chinese counterpart, here last week. And I had a productive meeting with China’s new Finance Minister, Lan Fo’an, this week. President Biden and I believe strongly in advancing the values we share with our allies and partners, in the Asia-Pacific and beyond, while also pursuing a healthy and stable economic relationship with China. Going forward, we hope to build on the foundation we’ve laid to further deepen communication, stabilize the relationship, and make progress on key policy issues. There is hard work ahead of us, but I believe our engagements here have moved us along the right path.As the United States nears the end of a productive APEC host year, I am impressed by all we’ve collectively accomplished across our priority areas. We congratulate Peru on its upcoming host year and look forward to supporting its work. And through APEC and otherwise, the United States will remain committed to deepening our economic ties with the Asia-Pacific. Advancing our shared vision is crucial to the success of Asia-Pacific economies, and it supports jobs, growth, and resilience at home in the United States as well."
10,,"November 13, 2023","Good morning, and welcome to the 30th annual Finance Ministers’ Meeting. Thank you to the City of San Francisco for hosting us and to all of you for being here.Let me start by putting this meeting in its larger context. The Asia-Pacific region is at the center of the global economy. APEC members represent some of the fastest growing and most dynamic economies in the world, driving both growth and innovation. So, the actions we take matter, not only for our own economies and people, but also for addressing the global challenges the world faces. And as we seek to achieve our shared vision of an open, dynamic, resilient, and peaceful Asia-Pacific community, coordination and collaboration among our economies is crucially important. The United States has been glad to help further this vision and our coordination by hosting APEC this year.  Throughout the year, APEC members have met across the United States to cover a wide range of key topics. And as we work collectively and individually to advance our vision, finance and fiscal policies are among the most powerful tools we have. This is why the United States elevated the Finance Ministers’ Meeting to be part of APEC Economic Leaders’ Week this year. And 2023 has been a pivotal year for the Finance Ministers’ Process. After several years during which we rightly prioritized our response to and then our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve now refocused on the longer-term priorities established by APEC Finance Ministers in the 2015 Cebu Action Plan. The Action Plan emphasizes strengthening financial resilience and advancing fiscal reforms to build our economies over the long run. This effort starts with a full understanding of the global and regional economic and financial outlook, which we’ll discuss in session one. We’ll then turn to the three priorities we’ve focused on throughout this year: modern supply-side economics, sustainable finance, and digital assets. Let me highlight the progress we’ve made and where we hope to focus today for each of these priorities.First, in discussions this year, we’ve advanced our thinking on what I’ve been calling modern supply-side economics: that is, policies that expand the productive capacity of our economies while improving resilience and addressing inequality. We’ve identified policies to increase the quality and quantity of labor supply, strengthen public infrastructure, and invest in research and development and environmental sustainability. And we’ve conducted a survey of APEC members’ policy efforts on modern supply-side economics that I look forward to discussing further.Second, our work on sustainable finance has focused on how to mobilize resources to accelerate our just energy transitions and achieve our respective net-zero emissions goals. We’ve discussed how to finance efficient and effective energy transitions while supporting the individuals and communities who are most vulnerable. The Indonesia and Vietnam Just Energy Transition Partnerships are two powerful examples of these efforts. I look forward to hearing your responses to the Note to Ministers and to discussing your energy transition plans. We’ve also furthered work on voluntary carbon markets, including by hearing from experts on the state of these markets in APEC economies and discussing ways that authorities can help improve their integrity and depth. We’ve compiled research that highlights how finance ministries can support the development of these markets as part of our broader climate finance toolkits. I look forward to hearing today about how you are thinking about supporting the scaling and effectiveness of credible carbon markets. We’ve also discussed the climate-aligned finance approaches APEC members are putting in place to help private sector actors pursue credible and specific climate commitments. For example, Treasury is proud to have recently released the “Principles for Net-Zero Financing and Investment.” These Principles affirm the importance of credible net-zero commitments and encourage financial institutions that make them to take consistent approaches to implementation. But because approaches vary across jurisdictions, we also need to think through how best to address any inconsistences and promote interoperability. Our working lunch with private sector participants and our third session will be a chance to discuss how authorities and the private sector can jointly take action on this and other sustainable finance issues.Last, on digital assets, which we’ll discuss in session four, sharing insights and engaging with the private sector has enabled us to deepen our collective understanding of the tools that policymakers can use to facilitate the responsible development and use of digital assets, including unbacked crypto-assets, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies. We’ve specifically explored the potential benefits and challenges of these innovative financial tools and approaches to maintaining high regulatory standards.  Today, I look forward to hearing your perspectives on the long-term role that digital assets and blockchain technologies can play in our respective financial systems, as well as how your authorities plan to approach regulatory oversight of their development and use.The fact that these priority areas are oriented toward the long-term does not make addressing them any less urgent. We need to further improve our long-term economic outlook by boosting labor supply, innovation, and infrastructure investment, in ways that are also sustainable and reduce inequality. We need to put ourselves on a sustainable growth path, one where we safeguard our planet while providing our economies with the clean energy they need to grow. And we need to leverage emerging technologies to drive innovation while maintaining safe financial markets. With that, thank you again for your work and the work of your teams throughout this year, and for being here today. It’s a key opportunity to recognize our accomplishments and reaffirm our commitment to more progress. Our efforts are essential to the strength of our economies, the prosperity of our peoples, and the future of the global economy.  "
11,,"November 12, 2023","Good evening. Welcome to the APEC Finance Ministers’ Meeting gala. And a special welcome to Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and Mayor London Breed. We’re honored you could join us. It’s personally meaningful to me to conclude the United States’ APEC host year here in the San Francisco Bay Area, which I consider a second home. I spent more than two decades here—from my time teaching at Berkeley to serving as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.And it’s especially fitting that we’re at the California Academy of Sciences. The Academy’s Steinhart Aquarium is one of the world’s most biologically diverse aquariums, reflecting two marine ecosystems: the California coast and the Philippine Coral Reef, connected by the Pacific Ocean. And the Academy is a leader in conservation and sustainability, from its educational programming, to partnerships to inform conservation policies, to the physical design of the building we’re in now—which includes a roof of living native plants.So, being here is a powerful reminder: not only of the ocean that connects our economies and makes us APEC members but also of the important work we are doing through APEC. Climate change poses threats to our homes, our communities, and our livelihoods. From heat waves and droughts here in California to the floods in Indonesia, the physical and economic impacts of climate change are mounting, with implications for the growth and stability of APEC economies.So, APEC has made addressing climate change a key priority. In 2020, APEC Leaders endorsed the Putrajaya Vision, which centered on sustainable and inclusive growth. In 2022, Leaders adopted the Bangkok Goals for the Bio-Circular-Green Economy. And I am proud that the APEC Finance Track has also taken up climate change so fully this year. Of course, sustainable finance is only one aspect of the much broader work we’ll be discussing this week—from promoting inclusive and sustainable growth to supporting responsible innovation across our economies. And this is all to advance a shared vision of an open, dynamic, resilient, and peaceful Asia-Pacific region.Welcome again to this beautiful Academy, to a city I consider a second home, and to an APEC Finance Ministers’ Meeting the United States is proud to host. I very much look forward to our discussions tomorrow. And I hope you enjoy our entertainment for the evening. Please join me in welcoming musical guests from the San Francisco Chorus, San Francisco Opera, and San Francisco Symphony."
12,,"November 12, 2023","We continue to strengthen bilateral relations between our nations. This meeting follows a very successful State Visit by Prime Minister Albanese last month in which he and President Biden helped inaugurate a new era of U.S-Australia strategic cooperation.As the President said during Prime Minister Albanese's visit last month, the alliance between Australia and the United States has never been more important than it is today. And the U.S. has never been more committed than we are today.I am especially excited to meet during APEC Economic Leaders’ Week as Australia is a strong partner of the United States in this important forum. I would like to thank you for your collaboration on our policy priorities this year, particularly on sustainable finance and modern supply side economics."
13,,"November 12, 2023","This is a particularly exciting time for bilateral relations between the United States and Indonesia, as the timing of our ministerial coincides with President Jokowi’s visit to Washington—marking a new phase of bilateral cooperation and friendship between the world’s second- and third-largest democracies.I would like to thank Indonesia for your strong support of the United States’ APEC host year and your collaboration on the key policy areas, including sustainable finance, digital assets, and modern supply side economics.I would also like to congratulate the Government of Indonesia for releasing the Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan for public consultation under the Just Energy Transition Partnership. We look forward to celebrating the launch of the plan at COP-28.Congratulations as well on achieving full membership in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Indonesia has successfully demonstrated a firm commitment to meet global Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism standards, and the U.S. Treasury welcomes the collective work we’ll pursue through the FATF to counter illicit finance."
14,,"November 10, 2023","I’m very glad to have had the opportunity to welcome Vice Premier He Lifeng to California. I’d like to speak now to our economic approach to China and how we’ve advanced it through two days of productive discussions.The relationship between the United States and the People’s Republic of China is one of the most important relationships of our time. The path it takes will shape opportunities and challenges for people in both our countries and around the world. As I said last week, President Biden and I are advancing a vision of the world grounded in values we share with our allies and partners across the globe. And while we will at times use economic tools to protect our national security interests, our vision also includes a healthy and stable economic relationship between the United States and China that benefits both sides and offers a level playing field for American firms and workers.We know advancing this vision is not easy. But I believe that we have made significant progress since President Biden and President Xi’s meeting in Bali almost exactly one year ago. Following President Biden’s directive to deepen bilateral communications, I met with my former counterpart in January and then traveled to Beijing in July to build relationships with China’s new economic leadership. There, I met with Premier Li, Vice Premier He, and other senior economic officials. We had candid and constructive meetings on issues from macroeconomic developments, to the nature of our economic relationship, to challenges from climate change to debt distress in low-income countries. In September, the United States and China launched the Economic and Financial Working Groups to provide ongoing channels for engagement on substantive economic and financial policy issues. Both Working Groups met for the first time in recent weeks and had their second meetings yesterday.Over the past two days, Vice Premier He and I have built on this foundation with candid, direct, and productive engagements. There is no substitute for in-person diplomacy, and I was pleased to have had the opportunity to interact with the Vice Premier on a more personal level, as we did in our private meeting earlier today. During our discussions, we agreed that in-depth and frank discussions matter, particularly when we disagree. And I emphasized that the current uncertain global landscape makes it particularly crucial that we maintain resilient lines of communication going forward. This is not just communication for communication’s sake. It allows us to avoid misunderstandings and unintended escalation, make informed decisions, and work toward specific policy outcomes.Turning to the details of our discussions, I spoke to Vice Premier He about our goal of achieving a healthy economic relationship that benefits both our countries over time. We do not seek to decouple our economy from China’s. This would be damaging to both the U.S. and China and destabilizing for the world. But a healthy economic relationship requires American workers and firms to be treated fairly. I raised concerns about the breadth and depth of the PRC’s non-market policies and practices and their global spillovers. These are concerns that I hear frequently from U.S. businesses.Vice Premier He and I also focused on the need for joint work on global challenges. The physical and economic impacts of climate change are mounting across the globe, including here in California. We discussed specific areas where we can enhance our cooperation on climate finance beyond our co-chairing of the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group. I also underscored that too many countries continue to face high risk of debt distress and a debt architecture that does not work as it should to support them. I emphasized the need for us to build on our good recent progress in the Zambia case to make much faster progress on other debt restructuring cases. And we discussed the crucial roles we have to play in making the debt architecture work better and faster. We also spoke about our efforts to promote global financial stability as well as the importance of strengthening the World Bank, IMF, and other parts of the international financial architecture. Earlier this week, we took a positive step toward strengthening the IMF with the Executive Board’s approval of an equiproportional quota increase. This would bolster the IMF’s ability to fight crises at a critical time for the world economy.Finally, the United States continues to clearly communicate how we are using economic tools to protect our national security interests and those of our allies: through transparent and narrowly scoped actions designed to achieve a clear national security objective. I reaffirmed the importance of directly communicating the design and intentions behind our national security actions to avoid the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation, as the United States has done with our rollout of the Executive Order on outbound investment. We exchanged information about our respective outbound investment regimes. I also specifically raised our concerns about the PRC’s export controls on graphite and other critical minerals. And I stressed that companies must not provide material support for Russia’s defense industrial sector and that they will face significant consequences if they do.Today, Vice Premier He and I are also taking the important additional step of laying out specific areas of the bilateral economic relationship where we agree. My hope is that this understanding will serve as a foundation for future, mutually beneficial, progress. First, we agreed to intensify communication, including continuing a regular cadence of contact between me and the Vice Premier. Second, we committed to work together on global challenges from debt issues to climate change related economic issues. And third, both countries jointly stated that we welcome the objective of a healthy economic relationship that provides a level playing field for companies and workers in both countries and benefits the two peoples. Of course, there are many remaining areas of disagreement between our countries. And we know that there is an important difference between words and actions. But the United States will live up to the understandings that we reached – and we expect our counterparts to do the same.As I said at the conclusion of my meetings in Beijing this summer, I believe that my trip to China helped  advance our effort to put the U.S.-China relationship on surer footing. The past two days of meetings in San Francisco have served as another step forward. I am confident that our discussions have also helped lay further groundwork for a productive meeting between President Biden and President Xi.Next week, we will also chair – and China will participate in – the APEC Finance Ministers’ Meeting and Leaders’ Meeting. In the coming months, our teams will continue deepening our communication through the Working Groups. And Vice Premier He also told me that he welcomes a return visit by me to China, and I look forward to traveling there next year.With that, thank you again for being here. The United States may have begun as an Atlantic nation, but we have long been a Pacific one as well. California is a fitting place to mark the progress we are making in our economic approach to China and to affirm our commitment to the work ahead."
15,,"November 9, 2023","Vice Premier He, welcome to the United States. I appreciated the welcome you gave me when I arrived in Beijing in July. And I am pleased to have this opportunity to host you in California for our second meeting. I’ve spent much of my life in the San Francisco Bay Area and consider it my second home. It’s also a place where the United States’ ties to Asia are clearly apparent—from San Francisco’s vibrant Chinatown to deep economic linkages.It’s a fitting place to take forward the significant progress the United States and China have made in deepening our communication. One year ago, President Biden and President Xi had their first in-person meeting. In July, I traveled to Beijing and had extensive official talks over two days with Premier Li, you, and other members of the new Chinese economic team. In recent weeks, the Vice Minister-level Economic and Financial Working Groups between the U.S. Treasury and Ministry of Finance and PBOC met for the first time. I hope to build on this strong foundation with an open and substantive discussion over the next two days. As I’ve said, the United States has no desire to decouple from China: A full separation of our economies would be economically disastrous for both our countries, and for the world. We seek a healthy economic relationship with China that benefits both countries over time. When we have concerns about specific economic practices, such as those that prevent American firms and workers from competing on a level playing field, we will communicate them directly. Beyond our bilateral economic relationship, I look forward to discussing our collaboration on global challenges, from climate change to debt distress in low-income countries and emerging markets. As the world’s two largest economies, we have an obligation to lead on these and other issues, for the people in our countries and around the world.We will also further our discussions on the use of economic tools for national security purposes. The United States will continue to take targeted actions to protect our and our allies’ national security. But we are also committed to communicating clearly about these actions to prevent any misunderstandings or miscalculations. And we welcome more clarity on China’s thinking and actions. "
16,,"November 27, 2023","WASHINGTON – From November 26 – December 1, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
17,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
18,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

20,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
21,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

22,,"November 7, 2023","Good afternoon everyone. Thank you to Ken Corbin, IRS wage and investment commissioner and Chief Taxpayer Experience Officer, for the introduction and for your and your team’s great work. And thank you to Commissioner Danny Werfel for your leadership and deep commitment to driving change. Over the past year, I’ve been able to visit several Internal Revenue Service facilities to announce the significant milestones made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act and the hard work of IRS employees. Today, I’ll again speak to the tremendous progress that we’ve made together.  And I’ll announce our goals for the 2024 tax filing season.The current proposals to cut funding for the IRS make this an especially crucial time to talk about the importance of this work. Playing politics with IRS funding is unacceptable. Cutting it would be damaging and irresponsible. The IRS collects 96 percent of the federal government’s revenue. This is the funding that enables our country to protect our national security, provide social security and healthcare, and invest in our nation’s infrastructure, among other key priorities. The IRS is also one of the few parts of government that touches nearly every American household. Taxpayers deserve a system that allows them to meet their obligations and contribute to our country’s strength with pride and ease.Instead, the tax system has lagged far behind the digital age in which we now live. We see this in examples like the cafeteria in an Austin processing center that had become so full of paper it could no longer function as a cafeteria. This backlog was due not just to COVID but to decades of underfunding. Despite the hard work of IRS employees, this meant the system has struggled, with too slow processing times, unnecessary errors, and a significant tax gap: the amount of taxes owed but not paid. In 2019, the top one percent of Americans was estimated to owe over one-fifth of unpaid taxes, leaving ordinary Americans to shoulder the burden. All of this has had real negative impacts on people’s lives, causing frustration and unpredictability for too many Americans. And it is reducing the revenue our country can invest in our key priorities.The Biden Administration recognized the need for a fundamental shift. And thanks to Congress’ support, the Inflation Reduction Act will make a modernized IRS a reality, provided robust discretionary funding is also maintained and funding is not cut. The result will be a tax system fit for the 21st century: One that meets our country’s needs and makes life better for Americans across the country. And this isn’t just about transforming routine tax collection, which has allowed the cafeteria in Austin to be cleared of paper and go back to serving as a cafeteria. The IRA will leverage a modernized tax system to drive long-term investments as well.First, massive investments in customer service mean taxpayers will get the information and support they deserve. We made a tremendous leap forward last filing season, for example, by drastically reducing phone wait times. This filing season, we will build on this foundation and continue expanding services for taxpayers: by phone, online, and in person.By phone, we will again commit to an 85 percent level of service during the filing season, meaning the vast majority of callers will be connected to live assistors and get support. We’ll also commit to an average call wait time of five minutes or less, and nearly all callers will be able to take advantage of a callback option in the rare situations in which the wait time is much longer. This is a world away from the 2022 filing season, when callers faced an average 10 to 15 percent level of service, an average phone wait time of nearly 30 minutes, and a much more limited callback option.We’ll also expand robust online support. In 2022, 54 million unique taxpayers used the popular “Where’s My Refund?” tool. That’s 16 percent of the U.S. population. So, we’re continuing to invest in improvements. This filing season, “Where’s My Refund?” will incorporate conversational voice bot technology to help taxpayers get answers more quickly. And it will provide clearer and more detailed information so taxpayers can address barriers to processing their returns and receive their refunds quickly.We also know there’s sometimes no substitute for face-to-face support. But Tax Assistance Centers—which provide in-person support to local communities—have historically been under-resourced and understaffed. This filing season, Taxpayer Assistance Centers across the country will collectively offer over 8,000 more hours of in-person assistance than they did last filing season. We’ll also expand efforts to reach taxpayers in hard-to-reach areas who otherwise have difficulty accessing in-person assistance. To do this, we’ve added a new form of assistance: temporary pop-up centers, such as in Ciales, Puerto Rico and Gallup, New Mexico. Taxpayers across the country will also continue to benefit from strong volunteer support. We anticipate that Volunteer Income Tax Assistance will expand free assistance by approximately 50,000 returns this filing season.We’re pairing our investments in customer service with investments to upgrade our technological infrastructure. Last August, I announced an ambitious goal: For the 2024 filing season, taxpayers would be able to choose to digitally upload all correspondence and responses to notices, instead of mailing them. I am proud to announce that we met this goal last month, much ahead of schedule. The impact will be significant and far-reaching. Taxpayers will save time and effort. The IRS will reduce errors and storage costs. And we’ll speed up processing times for the system as a whole. Today, I’m announcing another key milestone to make the IRS even less reliant on paper processing. By the start of the filing season, taxpayers will be able to electronically file 20 additional tax forms, including some of the most common forms for businesses.The IRS is also launching a limited-scope Direct File pilot. Starting this filing season, eligible taxpayers in 13 states will be able to electronically file their federal tax return directly with the IRS—for free. The pilot is an opportunity to learn: We’ll test the taxpayer experience, technology, customer support, state integration, and fraud prevention and then apply these insights as we consider scaling to more users.The ambitious targets we’ve set and will keep setting are achievable but by no means easy. And while we’ll all benefit, it is IRS staff who will do the hard work to get us there. So, alongside investing in customer service and new systems, we’re continuing to invest in our greatest asset: the IRS workforce. We’re hiring even more employees focused on taxpayer services. We’re also strengthening enforcement, with a focus on high earners. Our fair enforcement initiative is about both fundamental fairness and raising much-needed revenue. And we are making progress. Thanks to strengthened enforcement, the IRS collected $160 million in just a few months from millionaires who had not paid their outstanding debt. It has announced new initiatives to use artificial intelligence to uncover tax evasion by large corporations and complex partnerships. And for this filing season, we’ll drive even more progress by hiring employees with specialized expertise to focus on audits for high-wealth filers, large corporations, and complex partnerships.These employees will join an extremely dedicated workforce: all of you. You have always gone above and beyond. But more recently, you’ve been asked to step up even more. During the pandemic, you worked particularly long hours in difficult conditions to keep our tax system running and help make it an engine of an equitable recovery. Now, you are part of this Administration’s work to build a fairer and more efficient tax system. And your work goes beyond that. A modern tax system will enable the implementation of key IRA provisions, such as credits to increase energy efficiency in homes across the country. These are lowering costs for consumers and bringing our country one step closer to our net-zero goals. Other credits are fueling the emergence of a battery belt across the Midwest and South, creating new American manufacturing jobs and bolstering our country’s supply chain security. So, your work to strengthen the IRS is contributing to strengthening our country’s economic growth and resilience.With that, thank you again for having me here today. And thank you for your service. Our IRS modernization effort is improving the day-to-day lives of Americans across the country. And through enabling revenue collection and supporting key parts of the President’s Investing in America agenda, it will help drive our country’s economic strength for decades to come. Congratulations on all you’ve already achieved, and I look forward to the achievement of more milestones ahead."
23,,"November 3, 2023","Our first agenda item is to discuss and vote on the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s analytic framework for financial stability risk identification, assessment, and response, and on the Council’s interpretive guidance on nonbank financial company designations. Before we turn to the presentation, I’d like to explain why I believe it is so important for the Council to achieve greater public transparency and analytic rigor and how these two documents will help the Council do so. Financial stability is a public good. The U.S. financial system enables people to make payments, build businesses, save, and manage risks. To fill our needs, it has evolved to be complex, diverse, and interconnected. We rely on it every day, and it has succeeded in supporting American families and businesses, enabling wealth creation and economic growth over generations. But, when it falters, we can experience financial crises that can devastate households and businesses for years afterwards.  This is where the Council, or FSOC, comes in. Congress created FSOC after the global financial crisis to identify and respond to risks to financial stability. To maintain the strength of the financial sector, we need a nimble but robust structure to monitor and address the build-up of risks that could threaten the system. In the lead-up to the global financial crisis, inadequate oversight led to reckless risk-taking. When large, interconnected financial companies failed in 2007 and 2008, stress spread through the financial system and then to the real economy. The reforms implemented after that crisis substantially strengthened the financial system. And the banking system as a whole remains strong. But recent stresses in some financial sectors arising from the onset of the pandemic and the sudden failures of some regional banks underscore the continuing need to remain vigilant to threats to ensure the resilience of the financial system and our economic strength.  Our first vote will be on approving the Council’s analytic framework for financial stability risks. This framework will help the public better understand how the Council goes about its work and how it draws on its various statutory tools to respond to risks. For the first time, it provides a clear explanation of how the Council monitors, evaluates, and responds to potential risks to financial stability, regardless of whether they come from activities, individual firms, or other sources. Under the framework, the Council’s response to a particular risk to financial stability will depend on the nature of the risk. Often, risks emanate from widely conducted activities and can be effectively addressed through action by an existing regulator or interagency coordination. Other times, risks are instead concentrated in one or more specific nonbank financial companies. This brings me to the Council’s guidance on nonbank financial company designations. Among the tools Congress gave the Council is the authority to designate a nonbank financial company for Federal Reserve supervision and prudential standards if the company’s distress or activities could pose a threat to financial stability. The guidance we are voting on today will help ensure that the Council is able to use this authority as needed. It describes in detail the procedural steps for the Council’s review of nonbank financial companies for potential designation. These involve rigorous analysis and transparency. The guidance maintains strong procedural protections for companies under review, including significant Council engagement and communication, and provides them with opportunities to be heard. The guidance also affirms that the Council will engage extensively with companies’ primary financial regulators. The guidance also eliminates several prerequisites to designation in place under the current guidance that were not contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act and that are based on a flawed view of how financial risks develop and spread. And, again, designation is only one of the Council’s tools and is not being prioritized over other approaches to addressing financial stability risks. In voting to adopt the analytic framework and guidance, we will increase the transparency of the Council’s work and establish a durable process for the Council’s use of its designation authority, strengthening the Council’s ability to promote a resilient financial system that supports all Americans.  "
24,,"November 3, 2023","Good morning, and thank you for being here. I’ve had excellent engagements with many of your finance ministers over the past three years as Treasury Secretary, and I’m very glad to welcome you to Treasury today.Thank you, Senator Dodd, for joining us. As the Special Presidential Advisor for the Americas, you play a crucial role in taking forward initiatives that come out of the Summit of the Americas, including APEP.And my thanks to President Goldfajn for being here as well. APEP countries are fortunate to have in the IDB a vital partner, now with renewed energy and ambition, dedicated to serving our region. Ilan, I enjoyed my visit to the IDB yesterday. And I’ve appreciated your focus throughout your presidency so far on delivering results, strengthening the relevance of the IDB Group for its borrowers, and rejuvenating it as a forum for hemispheric cooperation.All of us here today share the value of democracy, aspirations of prosperity and regional security, and the belief that deeper economic integration, increased competitiveness, and greater investment can help bring about stronger, more sustainable, and more inclusive growth. This is also a group of countries that have been at the vanguard of exciting change. Several of you are global leaders in the issuance of green and blue bonds. Others here are among the first to access financing from the International Monetary Fund’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust. You’re also reacting with political courage and smart public policy to other challenges, such as mass migration. In these and many other areas, the Treasury Department has been an active collaborator.We also face shared challenges. None of us have a magic wand to increase productivity to generate good jobs and higher wages. We must achieve an effective and fast green transition and harness rapid technological change to increase prosperity. COVID-19 hit our region extremely hard, and we each need to learn lessons to prepare our economies for future shocks. Crime and violence are both causes and effects of weak investment and job creation. And the fight against corruption, illicit finance, and tax evasion remains a constant challenge.First and foremost, dynamic private sectors fuel dynamic economies, in particular when government budgets are stretched, as they are in this region. This is why Treasury strongly supports reforming the IDB’s private sector arm, IDB Invest, to achieve much greater impact. My team at Treasury is working closely with President Goldfajn and IDB Group shareholders to define the policy reforms and financial scenarios that would enable a significant capital increase for IDB Invest. This involves considering ways to strengthen the entire IDB Group: a strong private sector needs a robust public sector and the private sector starts at the very local level, so the entrepreneurial ecosystem is key.I know that many of you want to see more American firms competing for opportunities in your markets. I thank Ilan for launching the “BID for the Americas” program to remind American firms of the opportunities in public procurement and public-private partnerships. Bid for the Americas uses the IDB Group’s expansive network to facilitate partnerships between American and regional firms in order to support the participation of American firms in regional contracts.Alongside increasing private sector investment, I want to highlight our work on critical supply chains as another key potential driver of growth in the region. The United States is pursuing an approach I’ve called “friendshoring”: diversifying our supply chains across a wide range of trusted partners and allies. I was in India and Vietnam earlier this year and saw firsthand the actions they are taking to become more competitive in order to participate in global supply chains. We believe that APEP countries are well-positioned to take the actions needed to benefit from friendshoring in our region. But new investment will not come automatically. The United States and the IDB Group have committed to working together to support your efforts to integrate into this region’s supply chain.Of course, we all know that achieving the objectives I’ve described requires more than low-cost financing and knowledge sharing. We also need good regulatory practices, human capital, effective institutions, and sound policies that will enable us to accelerate the green transition, harness technological change, and create an inviting environment for deeper private sector-led economic integration.In today’s discussion, I hope to hear from you about both your economic challenges and the opportunities you see on the horizon. I am also happy to answer any questions you have about how I see current developments in the U.S. economy and markets."
25,,"November 2, 2023",
26,,"November 2, 2023","Thank you to the IDB Group for hosting this Forum. And President Goldfajn, thank you for your remarks and for your leadership. I’m very pleased to open this event with you. And welcome to our distinguished guests. The 12 countries in the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, or APEP, are bound not just by our geography but also by our commitments to democracy, our shared values, and our aspirations of inclusive and resilient growth and regional security.  APEP offers our countries a key vehicle through which to deepen economic integration, increase the competitiveness of our region, drive private sector investment, and foster inclusive and sustainable development.  For the United States, APEP, and this Forum in particular, allow us to further deepen our partnerships with the IDB Group and with other APEP members and make concrete progress on our shared goals.Let me touch on one area where we have a unique opportunity to work much more closely together: efforts to diversify supply chains.  The United States is working with partners on what I’ve called “friendshoring,” meaning diversifying our supply chains with a range of trusted partners and allies.  This has tremendous potential benefits for fueling growth in Latin America and the Caribbean. And diversification provides not just the opportunity for a significant increase in trade, but also for innovation—in sectors from renewables, to medical supplies, to semiconductors.  Businesses from Latin America and the Caribbean—already important partners to the United States in the manufacturing of solar and wind technologies—will increasingly have the chance to lead in new areas of clean energy, for example, helping create vertical supply chains by using locally extracted lithium in local battery production.  In the health sector, medical equipment and pharmaceutical companies can grow and innovate to meet increased demand.  And in the semiconductor sector, the region’s skilled workers can scale up production of advanced materials, including the automotive chips necessary for the current and next generations of electric vehicles. As a result of APEP, the United States and the IDB have committed to work together to support the region’s supply chain integration through comprehensive efforts.  We will help provide low-cost financing, support knowledge sharing and worker upskilling, and engage with stakeholders from across the public and private sectors, academia, and civil society to identify and tackle bottlenecks, thereby bolstering the region’s competitiveness in priority sectors.  We are confident this work will help to further the outcomes of the Forum and the conversations you will all be having here today. For this supply chain integration work and across many other priorities, APEP countries are fortunate to have a vital partner dedicated to serving our region: the IDB Group.  As the largest source of development finance for the Latin America and Caribbean region, the IDB Group provides critical support to countries to create the conditions necessary for private sector-led growth to take off in the region. This leads to increased opportunity, more jobs, and greater economic wellbeing.  I am proud to reaffirm the Biden-Harris Administration’s firm commitment to working with the IDB Group, under Ilan Goldfajn’s excellent leadership, to support strong, sustainable, and inclusive economic growth undergirded by commitments to democracy, equality, transparency, anti-corruption, and the rule of law.  As the IDB’s largest shareholder, the United States has also led the call for ambitious systemic and structural reforms that will position the IDB Group to evolve to better take on pressing regional and global challenges.  We know the IDB Group can deliver better and deliver more through investments that are high-quality, competitive, and demonstrate results.The United States is also strongly committed to an IDB Invest capital increase.  We are working closely with our fellow shareholders and with our Congress to support IDB Invest.  We believe the additional capital would help increase IDB Invest’s impact and ability to better mobilize private capital to the region, including to APEP members.  An IDB Invest armed with more risk capital, a refreshed business model, new incentives, and new financial products will be even more effective at promoting private sector-led, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth and development.  IDB Invest CEO James Scriven’s originate-to-share approach, as one example, is pioneering a new way for MDBs to leverage private sector capital.  Other MDBs are closely watching.Again, thank you to the IDB Group and to President Goldfajn for hosting this Forum.  The United States supports your vision of an institution that will continue to be an engine for growth, change, and progress across Latin America and the Caribbean, and a key partner for achieving APEP’s goals.  I am confident the Forum today will enable productive dialogue and lead to constructive next steps to drive the integration and cooperation that will fuel the region’s inclusive growth."
27,,"October 25, 2023","John, thank you for that kind introduction. Your advocacy to ensure that the Freedman’s Bank legacy was not forgotten is on full display today and has inspired so many of our efforts. And good afternoon to all of you. My thanks for joining for the Biden Administration’s third Freedman’s Bank Forum. And thank you in particular to the HBCU students who are here with us today: It’s crucial that your voices help inform the conversations we’re having.We’ve accomplished a lot since the start of this Administration, and the Treasury Department is proud to have played a major role. Today is an opportunity to reflect on our efforts thus far so that we can continue driving progress going forward.All of us here know that the U.S. economy has not historically worked well for Black, Latino, Native, and many Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. And we also share a forward-looking vision: of an economy that unlocks the economic potential of people, communities, and businesses that have been left behind. We share this vision because it is fair, and also because it is good economics, crucial to our country’s economic strength and resilience. Over the past two and a half years, this vision has led us to help drive the most equitable recovery on record. Now, the same conviction underlies our work to build the most inclusive economy we can for the long term. In my remarks today, I’ll highlight some of the key tools we’ve deployed and the impacts our work is having.When President Biden took office, we faced the twin health and economic shocks of COVID-19. The President worked with Congress to pass the American Rescue Plan, which shaped our economic recovery and laid the groundwork for future growth. From the start, and especially through the American Rescue Plan, the Biden-Harris Administration and Treasury Department focused on the needs of the most vulnerable Americans. This included people of color, female-headed households, low-income families, and rural communities. We understood that effectively delivering services to these populations meant that we could not rely on a one-size-fits all approach. Instead, we prioritized the use of community-informed approaches, partnerships with trusted state and local partners, and data-driven program design. And through these efforts we helped drive a historically equitable recovery. Our work on housing is one example. Governments receiving funds from the American Rescue Plan’s Homeowner Assistance Fund were required to target assistance to below-median-income and socially-disadvantaged homeowners. These efforts worked. Thirty-five percent of homeowners receiving assistance self-identified as Black and 23 percent self-identified as Hispanic or Latino. As a result of these and other efforts, foreclosure rates remained the lowest they have been in nearly two decades, benefiting far more people than just direct recipients of funds.The Child Tax Credit is another example. In response to the threat COVID-19 posed to child poverty, we implemented the expanded Child Tax Credit, allowing tens of millions of families to receive hundreds of dollars per child in monthly support. The program brought over 700,000 Black children out of poverty in 2021 and cut overall child poverty almost in half. Devastatingly, the expiration of the expanded credit has since erased these gains, underscoring how much work we still have ahead.It is indisputable, however, that our efforts helped to drive a recovery that was both historically fast and historically equitable. As we show in a Treasury report released this week, the Black unemployment rate has fallen to historic lows. So has the gap between the Black and white unemployment rates. The Latino unemployment rate, which spiked more than that of any other ethnic group during the pandemic, has since fallen to pre-pandemic levels. These results were not inevitable. We made choices that helped combat this country’s long history of racial inequality and prevented the pandemic from further entrenching it.As I’ve said, these choices were founded on a belief that supporting vulnerable populations means better outcomes for all of us. And this same conviction drives our long-term actions. President Biden’s Investing in America agenda is rooted in what I call modern supply-side economics: an economic strategy to expand our economy’s long-term productive capacity while reducing inequality and environmental damage. We’re broadening economic opportunity, and, through that, fueling growth.I’ll focus today specifically on our efforts to help small and underserved businesses, centered on two things small businesses need: capital and new market opportunities.I’ll start with capital. Through the Emergency Capital Investment Program, we’ve invested more than $8.5 billion in community financial institutions, including $1.4 billion in Black-owned and Black-majority shareholder depository institutions. We are just receiving the first round of reporting. It shows that in about six months of lending in the second half of 2022, one third of total originations were “deep impact” loans, made to the hardest-to-serve borrowers. And this is just the start. Over the next decade, we expect that ECIP will result in nearly $80 billion in increased lending in Black communities and nearly $58 billion in Latino communities.Meanwhile, the State Small Business Credit Initiative is providing nearly $10 billion to increase access to capital and promote entrepreneurship, including $2.5 billion in funding and incentives to support underserved businesses and jurisdictions that successfully reach those businesses. I’m pleased we just announced that SSBCI will provide new funding for technical assistance grants to help build out the pipeline of diverse entrepreneurs in fields key for the Investing in America agenda. And, more broadly, we’re seeing significant growth. The number of Black active business owners increased by 10 percent from the start of 2021 to August 2023. The number of Hispanic active business owners increased by 26 percent. And more new business applications were filed in 2021 and 2022 than ever before.  To open doors to new market opportunities, we’ve started by walking the walk ourselves. Over the past two years, the Treasury Department has increased the dollar amount of contracts awarded to Black-owned businesses by 60 percent. In fiscal year 2022, we awarded more than $123 million to Latino-owned contractors, an increase of over 20 percent from the year before. The IRS has now committed to spend 19 percent of its overall procurement on small and disadvantaged businesses in 2024. And just this morning, several additional corporate leaders agreed to match the government’s commitment to spend 15 percent of their procurement dollars with small and underserved businesses by 2025. More firms doing so could generate hundreds of billions of dollars in new contracts for small and underserved businesses.More than simply contract awards, we’re seeing deeper efforts to build out supply chains for critical sectors such as renewable energy by working with diverse entrepreneurs. Also this morning, corporate leaders highlighted technical assistance programs they’re pursuing to foster the knowledge and capacity necessary for diverse entrepreneurs to compete for larger contracts. Like many of our efforts, this will benefit far more than these entrepreneurs. Companies across the United States face shortages of skilled workers and suppliers, so incorporating diverse businesses is also crucial to our efforts to build resilient supply chains.These efforts align with our broader push to drive investments in low-income communities, such as through boosting the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy investment tax credit through the Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program. This boost helps extend the IRA’s benefits to people and places that have been economically left behind. We are pleased to have opened the application process just last week.These and many other changes are having and will continue to have real impacts. We’re building on our equitable recovery and creating an inclusive economy for the long term. We’re working toward more economically robust communities, with families who can buy homes, find jobs, and support their children’s health and education.I know those in this room—from state and local government officials, to business executives, to non-profit leaders—are committed to this shared vision. We’ve learned and continue learning as we go. And I trust we will all continue to expand and deepen our efforts going forward. An economy that works for communities of color is an economy that works for all of us—fueling our economic strength and ushering in a better future. Thank you again to all of you for being here today and for being part of this crucially important work."
28,,"October 20, 2023","WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen today released the following statement following President Biden’s request to Congress for supplemental funding to support Israel and Ukraine: ""The United States must continue to combat global instability with strong leadership and unshakeable commitment. Whether the problem is Russia’s immoral invasion of Ukraine or horrendous terrorist attacks by Hamas in Israel, America’s leadership is irreplaceable.  The Biden Administration’s supplemental funding request maintains America’s global leadership and advances our core interests – including our national security.Our economic assistance – alongside tens of billions of dollars delivered or committed by our allies – has played a critical role in Ukraine’s valiant resistance to Russian aggression by supporting the Ukrainian home front in this war. Despite the damage Russia’s war has wrought, Ukraine has achieved progress in economic reforms, aided by the economic assistance provided by the United States and other donors.  Continuing this support from the United States and our allies is vital to the Government of Ukraine and its ability to deliver essential services such as humanitarian assistance and emergency response following missile strikes.  And as Ukraine braces for another long winter, this support helps its government reconstruct destroyed critical infrastructure and stabilize its economy.Beyond Ukraine, Hamas’s horrific attack and its regional impact are a terrible reminder of the uncertainty we see around the globe and the challenges it raises in the global economy. It also highlights the need for strong international financial institutions that stand ready to respond to economic spillovers of such unexpected crises. The United States is exercising its global economic leadership role to make sure that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is well equipped to promote stability and growth around the world. At the same time, the United States has been leading efforts, together with our partners, aimed at reforming the World Bank to support developing countries more effectively in responding to crises that transcend borders, such as conflict and fragility, and the long-term challenges they face. The President’s supplemental funding request will advance both of these critical goals and will promote high standards development models.In these times of great uncertainty, America must continue to lead to advance our national interests and protect the most vulnerable countries and people. If Russia prevails in Ukraine, our collective global and economic security will suffer a major blow. If instability spreads across the Middle East, the risks we face will multiply. And if we don’t lead on international economic issues, other countries will. We look to Congress, among others, to not let this happen."""
29,,"October 16, 2023","It’s a pleasure to join this conversation. The Brookings Institution deserves special thanks for its engagement on our efforts to address Putin’s barbaric war, especially on the policy we will discuss today. I am looking forward to speaking with you about the ongoing impact of the price cap and to share the latest on our work to maintain its effectiveness.  The price cap was born out of a response to Russia’s illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine. Though it is part of a broader sanctions response, it has two clearly defined goals.  First, to keep global energy markets well-supplied and avoid a price shock that would hurt the global economy – particularly emerging markets – and benefit Putin through windfall profits on the energy he was able to export. And second, to limit the Kremlin’s ability to fund its illegal war in Ukraine.In December 2022, the G7 price cap coalition instituted a price cap on Russian crude oil exports. In February, we instituted similar caps on refined energy exports. I outlined the history and operation of the price caps in more detail in London last August. The price cap has worked because the coalition controlled over 90 percent of the maritime services and insurance needed to export oil globally at the time of the price cap’s launch, and because attempts to build an alternative ecosystem are very costly. Global markets have remained well supplied with oil, and Russia must choose between accepting a steep discount (if they sell oil with G7 service providers under the cap) or incurring tremendous costs to build a new ecosystem that operated without G7 services.Our approach was precisely designed to force Russia to make hard choices. They could abide by the cap that we set and sell energy at a considerable discount, or they could invest massively in a shadow fleet. Such investments contribute to Russia’s growing fiscal deficit: buying tankers makes it harder for the Kremlin to buy tanks.Ten months after the implementation of the price cap on crude oil—and more than a year since we announced the policy and markets began to anticipate its effects—we can see that the first phase of our approach has been successful.We’ve been gratified to see relative stability in energy prices. In the absence of the price cap, some analysts predicted oil prices as high as $150 per barrel, which would have risked a global recession.We also know that Russian revenue from energy exports – the Kremlin’s key source of revenue – has declined 44% compared to last year, prompting public alarm from Russian economic officials. And because this figure doesn’t account for the large expense Russia has incurred trying to construct an alternative ecosystem of ships and services, the real economic toll for the Kremlin is significantly higher. There are significant signs of pressure on Russian government finance and on the Kremlin’s ability to manage its economy. Deficits have increased, their sovereign wealth fund is being drawn down, and the ruble has collapsed to the extent that the Central Bank of Russia has had to drastically hike interest rates.Russia has accepted a significant discount on oil sold under the cap, and also made a decision to spend huge amounts of money on an alternative ecosystem to sell oil without G7 involvement. The costs associated with this avoidance keep stacking up: Putin has purchased hundreds of new oil tankers for billions of dollars, and he faces elevated costs of insurance, longer transport times to new importers, elevated capital expenditures on domestic oil wells without G7 involvement, and reinvestments in ports that service non-G7 providers. In response to Russia’s decision to build up its own ecosystem for the transportation of oil at a significant cost to the Kremlin, we are now launching the second phase of our effort which will constrain Russia’s profits by increasing the costs associated with using non-G7 services. Last week, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on two entities and identified as blocked property two vessels that used Coalition service providers while carrying Russian crude oil above the Coalition-agreed price cap. This comes alongside other actions which underscore our resolve to force Putin into difficult choices and increase the costs of his illegal war.Also on Thursday, the G7 price cap coalition released a joint statement reiterating the risks of violating price cap rules. The statement says that “in the normal course of business, Coalition service providers may interact with market participants in other jurisdictions. Where we have evidence that companies or persons have engaged in illicit or deceptive practices related to shipments of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products, we will respond in accordance with the respective restrictive measures established by the Coalition Members.”The Coalition is issuing a Maritime Safety Advisory to “promote responsible practices in the maritime oil industry and enhance compliance with the price caps on crude oil and petroleum products. By adopting the recommendations in the advisory and previous guidance documents, industry stakeholders can reduce their exposure to possible risks associated with recent developments in the maritime oil trade.”These actions send a clear message that Russia will continue to be forced to face two costly options—selling under the cap and spending more to operate outside the G7 nexus—and that attempts to evade them will face a decisive and unified response. The Kremlin can abide by the price cap and continue to sell energy exports at significant discounts from global benchmarks. Or it can choose to further build a costly alternative ecosystem--drastically cutting into the profits Russia earns from each barrel of oil they export.  Because of the actions we announced last week–and the actions in coming weeks and months – those costs will continue to rise, and Russia’s ability to sustain its barbaric war will continue to weaken."
30,,"October 16, 2023","Today’s meeting allowed us to continue deepening our partnership through discussing two key areas of collaboration: economic support to Ukraine and our respective economic relationships with China.We reaffirm today that our coalition will continue supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes. The U.S. and EU have each provided significant support to Ukraine. This support is bolstering the home front to help Ukrainian citizens and to enable Ukraine to channel resources toward its resistance on the frontlines.Looking ahead, we must not allow our support for Ukraine to be interrupted. The Biden Administration is committed to getting Ukraine the assistance it needs to fight this war and support its people. This advances our national security and protects the values we and our allies and partners share. We will do everything possible to put in place a robust Ukraine package.Looking to recent developments in the EU, we particularly applaud the commitment to stand up a multi-year 50 billion euro Ukraine Facility. This Facility will cover a portion of Ukraine’s immediate financing needs and enable sustained support for reconstruction.We also discussed our joint and ongoing efforts to undermine Russia’s ability to financially sustain its unjust war. We’ve put in place an unprecedented multilateral sanctions regime and novel price caps on Russian oil. And we continue to evolve our efforts as the war continues, including through cracking down on sanctions evasion and ratcheting up pressure on the Kremlin. Collaboration is also crucial as we each deepen our communication and advance our economic relationships with China. Our work on outbound investments is one shared priority. The U.S. is currently implementing a targeted program on outbound investments, and we are eager to support similar efforts in the EU. Strengthening our critical supply chains is another key priority. Decoupling from China is not an option for the U.S. or for the EU. Instead, we are each pursuing approaches that center on diversification, or de-risking, and we have much to gain from collaboration here.I am very glad to have had the opportunity to be here today. I know President Biden is looking forward to hosting a summit with European Commission President von der Leyen and European Council President Michel this coming Friday. And I look forward to other future engagements with the Eurogroup and with Eurogroup members."
31,,"October 16, 2023","Hello everyone. I want to begin by reaffirming that the United States condemns the terrorist attack by Hamas on the State of Israel and stands with the Israeli people, as the G7 collectively stated last week. With that, thank you to President Donohoe for the invitation. I’ve appreciated the opportunity to join past meetings in Brussels and Washington, and I’m glad to be here in Luxembourg today.The United States and the European Union have forged an exceptionally strong partnership. I see that partnership as crucial to addressing global challenges and to advancing shared priorities. And in large part because of our collective work, the global economy is in a better place today than many thought it might be.In the United States, we’ve been able to bring about a fast economic recovery from a deep recession. Our unemployment rate remains historically low at 3.8 percent and inflation has declined significantly since its peak last year. We’re also investing in our long-term economic strength. President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act form a trifecta of historic legislation that advances what I’ve been calling modern supply-side economics: expanding our economy’s long-term productive capacity while reducing inequality and environmental damage.Europe has also made considerable progress in its economic recovery from the pandemic, even while contending with the direct spillovers from Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine. As a labor economist by training, I am particularly heartened that Europe’s labor markets are stronger than ever, with the EU’s employment rate at a record high. Let me be clear about what we see from across the Atlantic: Europe stands strong and resilient despite Putin’s attempts to weaponize Russia’s energy exports against the region. And the United States has been proud to stand with you in this effort. The U.S.-EU Task Force on Energy Security and the increase in U.S. exports of liquified natural gas are examples of our joint efforts, which I know complement the hard decisions you’ve taken at home to reduce demand for natural gas. I realize there are more decisions to make in coming months to support Europe’s recovery, including your ongoing work on reforming the Stability and Growth Pact. I hope that the final agreement, while incentivizing sustainable debt levels, also allows for pursuing growth-enhancing investments.As we each respond to global events that threaten economic growth, I’d like to focus on two key areas of collaboration: our support for Ukraine and our respective economic relationships with China.Strong support for Ukraine of course remains a top priority for both the United States and Europe. The United States has provided robust budget support, and our allies, most notably here in Europe, have as well. During my visit to Kyiv, I saw firsthand the importance of our economic assistance in addition to military support. Economic assistance bolsters the home front—Ukraine’s schools, first responders, hospitals, and other basic services—to make possible our efforts to sustain Ukraine’s resistance on the frontlines. As I’ve said before, we cannot allow Ukraine to lose the war for economic reasons when it has shown an ability to succeed on the battlefield.The Biden Administration is committed to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes. President Biden and I, along with a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Congress and the American people, will fight so that our support is not interrupted and sufficient funding is in place going forward. We will work with Congress to pass a robust Ukraine package into law.I know you share this commitment as well. I applaud the plans to stand up a 50 billion euro Ukraine Facility to provide sustained economic and reconstruction support. Economic support to Ukraine should have maximum concessionality. Flexibility is also important, as it could enable front-loading budget support in the immediate term when it is needed most. Ukraine has also been able to unlock a $15.6 billion IMF program in part due to international financial support and on-time delivery on reform and accountability measures to maximize the impact of each dollar and euro. And, looking ahead to additional sources of assistance, I support harnessing windfall proceeds from Russian sovereign assets immobilized in particular clearinghouses and using the funds to support Ukraine, which the G7 has now committed to exploring.Ultimately, we are in it together. We know that, as President Zelenskyy has said, our support is “not charity”; it’s an investment in “global security and democracy.” Our assistance is crucial to our collective national security interests and to our shared goal of a free and prosperous Europe and world.Our support to Ukraine is also complemented by our joint efforts to impose increasing costs on Russia for waging its reckless war. We’ve put in place a novel price cap policy, which has significantly reduced Russian revenue over the last 10 months while promoting stable energy markets. We continue to take additional action to ensure that Russia faces hard choices: either sell oil at a significant discount or spend huge amounts on an alternative ecosystem. We announced new sanctions just last week and cracking down on sanctions evasion is a focus this year. Europe has been a key partner in this effort. The EU’s 12th Sanctions Package, under discussion now, is an opportunity to clearly demonstrate that our coalition will continue to take bold, creative steps to deprive Russia of the revenue and material it uses on the battlefield. U.S.-EU collaboration is also crucial in our respective economic relationships with China. As I laid out last April, we do not seek to decouple our economy from China’s—We seek to diversify. To de-risk, not decouple, as President von der Leyen aptly put it. As we protect our national security interests, we seek open and direct communication to avoid misunderstanding and miscalculation. In July, I traveled to China to discuss U.S. priorities with China’s new economic team. It was a significant step in deepening our bilateral communications and one that we are continuing to build on, such as through the announcement of Economic and Financial Working Groups last month. I know many of you have traveled to China recently as well, and that Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis had a successful visit just last month.As we deepen communication and seek a healthy economic relationship with China, we are also focused on taking targeted actions to safeguard our national security interests—and those of our allies—and protect human rights. Our work on outbound investments is one key targeted national security measure. This past August, President Biden issued an Executive Order addressing certain outbound investments in sensitive technologies: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence. The Treasury Department is currently implementing this program. But like with so many of the risks we face, the concerns that informed this approach are not unique to the United States. We made a constructive joint statement on this last spring, and we look forward to supporting the European Commission’s efforts to continue examining this issue and determine next steps before the end of this year.We also need to work constructively together as we strengthen our critical supply chains. We face shared risks from common vulnerabilities and dependencies, and our work to each build resilience can support one another as well. In the United States, we are building a resilient semiconductor supply chain, like the one you are building in Europe. We’re also pursuing an approach I’ve called friendshoring—deepening economic integration with trading partners and allies we can count on. Our ongoing efforts toward a U.S.-EU Critical Minerals Agreement is a perfect example of putting friendshoring into action. This joint work to fortify the supply of the digital economy’s most essential input will mitigate shocks like the one we experienced during the pandemic, and it will bolster the resilience of our economies for years to come.With that, thank you again for having me. There are many areas on which our collaboration is crucial and there is much joint work to be done. I look forward to the discussion today."

Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
33,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here.

34,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

36,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
37,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

38,,"October 16, 2023","I’d like to thank Commissioner Gentiloni for meeting with me today to discuss our mutual global priorities, as well as recent U.S. and European Commission initiatives.  The European Commission has been an essential partner to the United States in forming an international coalition to provide Ukraine with crucial economic support.  Our partnership is durable and rooted in deep and broad economic and diplomatic ties.  The EU as a whole is our biggest trading partner and critical to our efforts to “friendshore” supply chains.In our meeting today, I look forward to discussing our shared responsibility to address Ukraine’s financing needs, the global minimum tax, and our respective China strategies.  "
39,,"October 13, 2023","Good morning. And welcome to the Multilateral Development Bank Evolution Roundtable. I am looking forward to a robust discussion with all of you today.We are at an important moment for the World Bank. One year ago, just ahead of the Annual Meetings, I issued an urgent call for the evolution of the MDB system to better meet the challenges we face in an interconnected world.As we heard yesterday at the Development Committee Plenary, we now have a broad coalition of shareholders standing by the World Bank as it evolves to deliver better and with a greater sense of urgency for low-income and emerging market nations.The World Bank evolution reforms that we have collectively pursued over the last year are a big step in the right direction and Ajay’s arrival has certainly sparked a fire to accelerate this work. But there is still more to be done.The United States is seeking to do its part. Our proposal to scale up World Bank concessional financing capacity reflects our commitment to evolution and our recognition that it will not succeed without sufficient attention to the immediate needs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries.It includes a guarantee to the new IBRD Portfolio Guarantee Platform that would enable $25 billion in new lending capacity and a large grant to the Global Public Goods Fund to buy down the cost of that new capacity to incentivize countries to invest in addressing global challenges.It also includes a $1 billion grant for IDA’s Enhanced Crisis Response window to support crisis response in IDA countries and limit the decline in IDA commitments over the last two years of the current replenishment.I was encouraged by G20 Leaders voicing support for this effort in the September communique and thank Germany for your announcement on hybrid capital. I encourage others to join us.There is plenty of work left to do -- the hard work of implementing the reforms we’ve adopted, completing the reforms that are already underway, and starting work on the longer-term and harder reforms that have yet to be taken up. And we are also extending this evolution agenda to the regional development banks. Ultimately, we will have done well when each institution is delivering better and faster, and when the MDBs are also working better together as a system."
40,,"October 11, 2023","The United States extends its deepest condolences to the people of Morocco and Libya, who have lost loved ones and now face the devastating impacts of once-in-a-century earthquake and floods.  We stand by the governments of Morocco and Libya as they take steps to recover from the destruction these disasters have wrought. As we gather for these Annual Meetings – for the first time in 50 years on the African continent – we are aware of two realities.  On the one hand, the global economy remains in a better place than many predicted, with growth outperforming expectations, and annual headline inflation falling in many of the major economies, including the United States.  At the same time, the global economy faces significant uncertainty.  Major shocks emanating from global challenges—the economic disruption from COVID-19; catastrophic, climate change-driven extreme weather events; and fragility and conflict in all parts of the world—have eroded development gains and disproportionately impacted the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries.  Russia’s illegal and unjustifiable war of aggression against Ukraine has caused a tragic loss of life, destruction of property, and has exacerbated global economic challenges by destabilizing energy and food prices.  We call on Russia to swiftly end this unjust war, which would help to rapidly reverse some of these trends and set the global economy on a more positive trajectory.  The compounding effects of these shocks have taken a terrible toll in terms of lives lost and livelihoods disrupted, and contributed to rising extreme poverty, hunger, and slower economic growth.  Further, their impacts have been more severe across emerging markets and developing countries, often in those countries that are already burdened by heightened debt vulnerabilities and have the least fiscal space to respond.We have undertaken important efforts over the last year to evolve the multilateral development banks (MDBs), starting with the World Bank, to better address global challenges, particularly climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict.  Addressing such challenges is in the national interest of all countries; mitigates risks to our collective economic outlook; and is integral to achieving poverty reduction and sustainable, inclusive, and resilient development.The United States is not alone in this undertaking.  Beginning with the Development Committee last year at the Annual Meetings, there has been a broad coalition calling for bold and urgent evolution reforms.  In the G20, the Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, the Africa Climate Summit, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Summit, the international community has also loudly and collectively voiced the importance of MDB evolution.  Through these fora we have all recognized that addressing global challenges and achieving poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth are mutually reinforcing, and we must all work together to build an MDB system better equipped to respond.  In the past year, shareholders and World Bank Management have worked together to advance the reforms that will enable the Bank to evolve to bring 21st century solutions to 21st century challenges.  We have updated the Bank’s vision and mission to reflect that addressing global challenges is a core part of reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity.  The Bank’s updated operational model will integrate global challenges through refocused diagnostics, enhanced country engagement, and greater support to sub-national entities.  It will also deliver a concessionality framework that will enable greater support to address global challenges.  Reforms to the IBRD financial model endorsed in the spring will yield around $50 billion in additional lending capacity over the next 10 years, with more possible in the near term given the establishment of the Portfolio Guarantee Platform and work to issue hybrid capital to interested shareholders.  This is just one part of the initial $200 billion in additional financial capacity we expect to achieve over the next decade across the MDB system through the G20 MDB Capital Adequacy Framework (CAF) Review recommendations that have been adopted or are under consideration.  The energy behind the evolution work has sparked similar efforts at the regional development banks, which together with the World Bank, will make the entire system deliver better.  These accomplishments are significant.  But our work is far from done.  It is crucial that the World Bank robustly implement the evolution reforms that have been adopted, complete work on those currently underway—like the concessionality framework and measures to increase speed and agility—and begin work on reforms that have not yet been taken up.  Specifically, we urge the World Bank to establish incentives for staff to incorporate addressing global challenges into country engagement, and fully implement the recommendations of the G20 MDB CAF Report, including the recommendation to incorporate a prudent share of callable capital in the Bank’s capital adequacy framework.  We also call on the World Bank to implement private capital mobilization (PCM) reforms that include incentives for staff to mobilize private capital rather than use own-account financing, ambitious portfolio-wide mobilization targets, clear reporting on results, and improved quality and accessibility of data in the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database.  The World Bank – and other MDBs – should develop scalable platforms to increase private investment, including securitization platforms, and they should scale and better utilize guarantees, insurance, local currency lending, and other de-risking tools to crowd-in investors.  We look forward to ideas from President Banga’s new Private Sector Innovation Lab on how all parts of the World Bank can step up efforts in these areas. Taken together, these reforms across vision and mission; the operating model; and financial capacity will build a better bank that delivers both more finance and greater impact.  And a strong and effective World Bank that is open and eager to partner with others is vital to having a strong and effective IFI system.In support of the evolution agenda, President Biden requested funding from Congress to contribute to the new Portfolio Guarantee Platform and the Global Public Goods (GPG) Fund.  This funding would unlock roughly $25 billion in new IBRD lending capacity, the terms of which could be bought down with the GPG Fund contribution to incentivize investments that address priority global challenges.  Evolution will not succeed, however, without sufficient attention to the immediate needs of the poorest and most vulnerable countries, that endure the harshest impact of global challenges and are least equipped to cope with them.  This is why President Biden also requested $1 billion for IDA’s Enhanced Crisis Response Window (CRW+).  We appreciate those who have joined us in boosting the concessional finance capacity of the World Bank and invite others to do the same.As the largest contributor to IDA-20, protecting the resources that go to these countries is a top priority of the United States.  This is why we strongly support efforts by IDA management to responsibly boost IDA’s capacity using existing resources, in addition to our own potential contribution to the CRW+, and we look forward to a successful IDA-21 replenishment next year. We welcome the efforts of the World Bank and other MDBs to drive food system transformation and strengthen food security through medium and long-term investment, policy reforms, and technical assistance, including through the IFI Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity launched last year.  Coordination plays a key role, and we are actively working with the MDBs to institutionalize the coherent approach fostered by the Action Plan, and applying lessons learned to future work.  Building resilience to shocks arising from global challenges is critical, which is why we must press forward with policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  The World Bank and other MDBs are key providers of public climate finance, mobilizers of private finance towards emissions mitigation and climate change adaptation, and supporters of innovative financing tools that accelerate the transition to net zero emissions and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.  The World Bank should screen all projects for cost-effective climate benefits, particularly to build resilience and adapt to the effects of climate change.  It is also critical that climate finance be targeted efficiently, and we urge alignment of global financial flows with the goals of the Paris Agreement and investment standards that incorporate transparency and accountability.  World Bank Country Climate and Development reports should serve a standard-setting function, helping countries advance their climate agendas by informing the design of the International Financial Institutions’ projects and programs, including specific and ambitious reforms for the country to implement.  Mobilizing the private sector is also instrumental to achieve progress towards our collective climate ambition.  The Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) are a promising model for mobilizing and aligning public, private, and philanthropic capital for the energy infrastructure and social investments needed to accelerate the transition towards a cleaner energy future in ways that benefit all communities.We recognize that the climate finance architecture is complex and developing countries can struggle to access available financing.  While an important source of financing, including much needed concessional financing, the climate finance architecture is not optimized to help countries access finance easily or to deliver finance at scale where the need is greatest or where the impact will be highest.  This is why the United States, working closely with partners, including the incoming G20 and G7 presidencies, is initiating an effort to review the climate finance architecture, with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the system.  As an implementing entity and host to some of the largest climate investment funds, the World Bank has an important role to play.  We call on the World Bank to assess how it can do a better job in helping countries access climate finance and help them to blend concessional resources from the specialized climate and environment funds with the Bank’s own resources.  By partnering with others, the World Bank strengthens the overall architecture.The enormous infrastructure gap in developing countries and emerging markets continues to hold back economic growth, the delivery of basic services, and trade.  We must do more to maximize the capabilities of the World Bank to support infrastructure development, including in the energy, transportation, health, digital, and critical minerals arenas.  Doing so will require stepped up efforts on project preparation and structuring—including scaling up the Global Infrastructure Facility—increasing access to knowledge and data, and assisting the implementation of policy reforms to create a more inviting environment for private investment.  The United States and its partners are proud to be focusing on significantly scaling up private capital mobilization to help close the infrastructure gap, including as a core component of the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGI).  Under PGI, the G7 is prioritizing strengthening supply chains, especially for critical minerals, with the creation of the Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) Partnership.Three years since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic it is evident that threats to global health can disrupt entire societies and the global economy.  That is why the United States remains committed to improving regional and global health security, and our contribution to the Pandemic Fund will catalyze investments to fill critical gaps in pandemic preparedness and bolster overall health security.  Recognizing the continuing risk of pandemic spillover, the World Bank should incorporate health-related risks and vulnerabilities, including an assessment for country pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response capacities, into its current work.  The World Bank will also need to coordinate with partners and with other efforts underway to strengthen the global health architecture.Over the last decade, violent conflict has spiked, causing immense human suffering, contributing to extreme poverty and to the significant displacement of people, while also stunting economic growth and absorbing a large share of national budgets.  We need strong collective action to mitigate the widespread impact of greater fragility and forced displacement.  The United States is committed to strengthening global resiliency and democratic renewal, and promoting peaceful, self-reliant nations that become strong economic and security partners capable of addressing shared challenges.  As part of the evolution initiative, and learning from the mid-term review of the Strategy for Fragility, Conflict, and Violence, we welcome the World Bank integrating new diagnostics, incentives, and approaches into its operations that address the root causes and impacts of fragility, conflict, and violence to help build countries’ resilience to potential fragility drivers within the country and spillovers from neighboring countries.  We urge the World Bank to redouble efforts to anchor and leverage strategic partnerships with peer institutions, civil society, and the private sector to strengthen its ability to respond with agility and impact in fragile contexts. The United States strongly supports the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the bold action needed to address global challenges that threaten to set back progress on achieving the SDGs.  The World Bank has made good progress with the Gender Strategy Update, and the Equality of Opportunity for Sexual Gender Minorities report, but it can do more to combat discriminatory laws and policies, along with their economic impacts, social and cultural norms around economic roles and responsibilities, and gender-based violence in its programming.  These considerations should be front and center as the World Bank assesses business and investment climates worldwide through the B-Ready report. Accountability and transparency in the multilateral institutions is essential for MDB projects to be successful, and for greater development impact and effectiveness.  This is why the United States will continue to press for greater access to, and disclosure of, information; stronger environmental and social safeguards, and robust governance; a culture of learning and accountability; and transparent and competitive procurement practices that are consistent with sustainable development.  We look forward to upcoming reviews that will bolster the World Bank’s sustainability, environmental and social framework, and accountability mechanisms.  The World Bank must continue to strengthen its approach to avoiding, reducing and mitigating harm in its projects.  Finally, corruption disproportionately hurts the poorest, undermining the World Bank’s ability to eliminate extreme poverty, boost shared prosperity, and build resilience.  There must be a culture of compliance across all levels of the Bank.   As we work towards a better World Bank that is fit for 21st century challenges, we recognize the efforts undertaken by World Bank President Ajay Banga, senior management, and the thousands of staff who have tirelessly worked towards this goal.  We are grateful for their energy, creativity, dedication, and collaborative spirit.  They represent multilateralism at is best – collective work to meet the world’s most critical needs and to meet the moment with great impact."
41,,"October 11, 2023","This, our fourth roundtable, is an important show of our continued condemnation of Russia’s aggression and of the robust international support for Ukraine from its allies and partners.Let me be clear about the war: the United States condemns Russia’s brutal war in the strongest possible terms.  Let me also be clear about our unwavering support.  We have provided robust economic support to Ukraine, and the United States will support Ukraine alongside our allies for as long as it takes.Russia’s unprovoked and horrific war has led to the terrible suffering of the Ukrainian people and massive economic damage.  It has also led to devastating effects on food security around the world caused by Russia’s callous targeting of Ukraine’s agricultural export infrastructure and its recent withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative.But Ukraine has shown valiant resilience and its government has done remarkable work over the past year and a half supporting Ukraine’s economy and the Ukrainian people.Through it all, President Zelenskyy has maintained a clear focus on fighting corruption and strengthening accountability and good governance.  Continuing to address these difficult issues will be key to delivering the future that Ukrainians deserve.Ukraine’s positive performance on its $15.6 billion IMF program to date has also been key for delivering macro stability and advancing reforms.  Continued efforts under the program will be essential to recovery and reconstruction.We also appreciate the focus of the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development on support for Ukraine.  The accountability and strong safeguards that the multilateral development banks provide are essential.We are heartened that our global partners in this effort continue to stand up in support of Ukraine.  That includes our European allies, who have stepped up and committed to providing 50 billion euros over four years for Ukrainian economic assistance and recovery.As an international community, we must continue to provide Ukraine the significant, predictable, and timely financial support it needs to keep the government running.And, in response to Russia’s war of choice, our historic sanctions coalition will continue restricting Russia’s access to the technology, equipment, and funds it needs to supply its military.That includes through our price cap on Russian oil and refined petroleum products, which has successfully targeted Russia’s key source of revenue while maintaining stability in global oil markets."
42,,"October 11, 2023","Hello everyone. Thank you to all of you for joining today, and to the Government of Morocco, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund for hosting the meetings. I’ve seen firsthand the impressive progress that Morocco is making to recover from the devastating impact of last month’s earthquake. The decision to proceed in Marrakech is a testament to the resilience of the Moroccan people. The United States is committed to supporting the Government of Morocco’s recovery efforts as Morocco works to provide immediate life-saving humanitarian assistance to those in need. These are also the first Annual Meetings in Africa in 50 years. It’s fitting we’re here, since Africa will shape the future of the global economy. Before highlighting priorities for this week, I want to also address the horrific attack by Hamas terrorists from Gaza this past Saturday. The United States condemns the attack in the strongest possible terms and stands resolutely with the people of Israel.Turning to our priorities here in Marrakech, I’ll start with the global macroeconomy. I’m very glad that some of the pessimism expressed when we met last year remains unwarranted. The global economy continues to be in a better place than many thought it might be. Projections for global growth are roughly the same as in July, and the IMF expects global inflation to continue to fall. And while some countries continue to experience slowing growth, we do not see signs of broad spillovers destabilizing the global economy. But we of course continue to closely monitor downside risks to the economic outlook.In the United States, we’ve had a historically strong recovery, driven by the Biden Administration’s economic plan. Unemployment is now at 3.8 percent and inflation has declined considerably. We’re also making long-term investments. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act are building America’s economic strength. And the impact will be felt far beyond the United States. As one example, the Inflation Reduction Act’s massive investments in clean energy will help address the global challenge of climate change, which is rightly high on the agenda this week.As we navigate risks to the global macroeconomy, we see Russia’s war against Ukraine as a major headwind and an affront to our values and to international law and the principle of territorial integrity. The Biden Administration is committed to supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes. Our actions matter for the Ukrainian people, for our own national security interests, and for the values we share with our allies and partners. And we are sharing the burden with these allies and partners, who have provided Ukraine with robust economic assistance and are similarly focused on ensuring accountability. Ukraine’s IMF program is also key to both delivering macroeconomic stability and advancing reforms.Looking ahead, I want to be clear that we cannot allow our support to Ukraine to be interrupted. Our allies and the Ukrainian people can rest assured that the Biden Administration – with the support of a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Congress and the American people – will work so that Ukraine receives the assistance it needs to win this war.We also continue to work to mitigate the other impacts of the war, including on food security, especially since Russia’s cruel withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative. And we remain focused on working with a global coalition to deprive Russia of the funding it needs to wage this unjust war. We’ve put in place a novel price cap policy, which has significantly reduced Russian revenue over the last 10 months while promoting stable energy markets. Global energy prices have been largely unchanged while Russia has had to either sell oil at a significant discount or spend huge amounts on its alternative ecosystem. I also support harnessing windfall proceeds from Russian sovereign assets immobilized in particular clearinghouses and using the funds to support Ukraine. Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine has caused untold human suffering and economic damage. We must continue to impose severe and increasing costs on Russia and continue efforts to ensure Russia pays for the damage it has caused.Our focus on the global macroeconomy and on addressing global challenges, including through the international financial system, also continues to shape our approach toward our relationship with China. As we protect our national security interests, we seek a healthy economic relationship that benefits both sides and cooperation on debt restructuring and global challenges like climate change. Following my visit to China this summer, we announced Economic and Financial Working Groups, a further significant step in continuing to deepen our communication. I look forward to meeting with People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng to discuss macroeconomic and financial issues while in Marrakech this week, including how Treasury and the PBOC take forward the Financial Working Group.Throughout the week, we will also be focused on advancing our work to evolve the multilateral development banks. These Annual Meetings mark the one-year anniversary of my call to evolve the MDBs. We have accomplished a tremendous amount in just one year, including forming a broad coalition to take the evolution agenda forward. But there’s much more to be done, and we need to keep the momentum going in conversations this week and when we return home. Notably, our evolution agenda doesn’t stop at the World Bank: It extends to the regional development banks and to how the MDBs work as a system.Turning to our efforts to strengthen the IMF, we are seeking to reach consensus on an equiproportional increase in quota resources to put the IMF’s finances on sound footing and keep it at the center of the global financial safety net. We’re also exploring ways to give more voice to developing countries through changes in the management and Board structure of the Fund. Finally, our focus on the international financial system also includes pushing for changes to make the debt architecture work better and faster, which is crucial for development and financial stability."
43,,"October 10, 2023","MARRAKECH - The setting of this year’s Annual Meetings in Marrakech is poignant for several reasons. It is the first time these Annual Meetings have been hosted in North Africa, and the first time they have been held on the African continent in exactly 50 years since the 1973 meetings in Nairobi. These meetings also demonstrate Morocco’s resilience and tenacity in the face of unspeakable tragedy and devastation following the recent earthquake. The United States stands by the people of Morocco and our gracious hosts in support and solidarity as they respond around the clock to those impacted by this disaster.In the five years since we last met outside the United States, the world has undergone multiple shocks that few could have imagined at the time — specifically, a devastating global pandemic and Russia’s illegal and immoral war against Ukraine, which continues to place a tremendous cost on the Ukrainian people and those around the world who are impacted by its spillovers. I welcome Ukraine’s continued strong performance under its IMF program, which is critical to Ukraine’s efforts to bolster economic stability and make progress on governance and anti-corruption. The United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.Global growth has proven more resilient than anticipated and inflation is easing in most countries. However, more recently, there are signs of slowing momentum in some countries, and we must remain attuned to the uneven nature of the global recovery and downside risks. Many countries have seen their fiscal balances deteriorate, and for many emerging markets and developing countries higher debt service costs are adding to pre-existing debt vulnerabilities.  Low-income countries have been particularly hard hit by the recent global shocks, and we saw an increase in global poverty for the first time in twenty years during the pandemic. Common challenges such as climate change and fragility and conflict have had an outsized impact on the most vulnerable.  Indeed, climate change is no longer a distant threat but a present-day crisis.  This past summer, no continent was spared from extreme and disastrous weather events during what we now know was the hottest summer on record. Most recently, we witnessed the devastating floods in Libya that cut so many lives short. The United States stands by the Libyan people in this time of grief and recovery.  In the United States, growth has proven resilient with a strong labor market including the lowest unemployment rate in over five decades. Our policies have supported a recovery in labor force participation and historic gains for women and minorities. Inflation has also moderated over the past year.  Our financial sector is strong and stable, our regulators are applying lessons learned to ensure that oversight remains robust, and we remain vigilant in monitoring potential vulnerabilities. We have built on our strong post-pandemic recovery by pursuing an economic agenda aimed at boosting the productive capacity of the U.S. economy, supporting a transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and investing in science and technology. This agenda will support the medium- and long-term growth of the U.S. economy with ambitious investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and globally important technologies and manufacturing inputs. These investments will have positive spillovers to the global economy from continued dynamism and growth in the U.S. economy, more resilient and diversified supply chains, and clean energy innovation and climate-forward technological progress.The multiple shocks to the global economy have underscored that the IMF is needed more today than ever.  Rigorous analysis, sound policy advice, capacity development, and well-targeted financial support, are core to the IMF’s mandate. We look to the IMF to help countries navigate through external shocks and to emerge from crises on a more sustainable footing.  To meet its mandate and address the needs of its membership, the IMF must have adequate and predictable resources.  The United States supports an equi-proportional quota increase that would restore the IMF’s status as a quota-based institution at the center of the global financial safety net and reduce its reliance on borrowed resources. We continue to call for the IMF to follow through on its commitment to a new quota formula that is both fair and simple and primarily reflects the economic size of its member countries, and regret that agreement on a new formula has not been reached.  In the absence of a new formula, an equi-proportional increase is the only viable outcome that avoids arbitrarily picking winners and losers. I urge all members to come together to support a successful conclusion to the 16th General Review of Quotas that would meet our shared objective of strengthening the IMF.  As part of our discussions on making the IMF more fit for purpose and responsive to the needs of its membership, we need to consider ways to elevate the voices of emerging markets and developing countries. We invite a discussion about adding a fifth Deputy Managing Director position so that one DMD position can be held by an emerging market economy and one by a low-income country. This would be the first expansion of this senior level of Management in over a decade and could help amplify the voices of the world’s fastest growing economies.  We welcome that sub-Saharan African members would like to pursue the creation of a third chair on the Executive Board for the region and stand ready to support them in this effort.The IMF also has a key role to play in helping low-income countries undertake reforms that enhance economic potential and inclusive growth, strengthen institutional frameworks, build long-term resilience to global shocks, and address underlying fragility and other challenges.  That is why we must also work to ensure adequate financing of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The United States demonstrated its commitment to the PRGT through a $70 million contribution to the subsidy reserve account last year, and we continue to urge Congress to authorize lending of up to $21 billion to support the PRGT as well as the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST). IMF management are urgently calling for additional pledges of $1.2 billion for subsidy resources. Although donor resources can help to meet the immediate need, putting the subsidy account on a sustainable footing will require further action.  I see further scope for the IMF to mobilize its own internally generated resources to support the PRGT’s longer-term subsidy needs. The IMF could fill a majority of the PRGT subsidy gap though a distribution and transfer of internal resources from the IMF’s reserves, while still maintaining a strong buffer of precautionary balances, in part due to the recent uptick in lending.  This would provide a way for all members to support low-income borrowers.The RST was developed to help vulnerable countries build resilience to external shocks stemming from climate change and pandemic related risks.  We welcome strong demand for the RST, and we must ensure RST resources are deployed as effectively as possible.  Programs should be well grounded in climate diagnostics with careful analysis of the costs and benefits of reform measures and linkage to balance of payments pressures. Conditions should be focused on deep institutional reforms that are needed to build resilience to climate shocks.  And coordination between the IMF and other institutions is paramount in order for RST programs to help countries achieve climate objectives. I welcome the recent joint statement on IMF and World Bank collaboration and call on the two institutions to further cement progress through more routine collaboration on World Bank climate diagnostic work that could be used to inform the upstream design of RST-supported programs. I also call upon the IMF to bring forward RST-supported programs designed around building resilience against pandemics, working with relevant partners with expertise in health-related projects.  As more countries turn to the IMF for policy advice and upper-credit tranche lending programs, it is critical that the IMF help countries correct underlying macroeconomic imbalances and undertake credible policy reforms that leave them on a more sustainable footing. The IMF must hold firm on necessary policy adjustments, as this speaks to the fundamental credibility of the institution, and because only sound programs that bring macroeconomic sustainability can put a country in a position to return to market access. The IMF’s continued leadership in macroeconomic and exchange rate surveillance is foundational for all of its other activities. It must call out distortive economic policies that have negative global spillovers, and it should be a key priority of the IMF to urge its members to adopt greater transparency, especially regarding foreign exchange intervention, to ensure that the costs of domestic policy adjustments are not passed on to trading partners. We commend the IMF’s work to operationalize the Integrated Policy Framework as part of its core mandate for assessing macroeconomic policy mixes.  The IMF plays a central role in supporting low- and middle-income countries in debt distress, including through the rigorous application of its debt sustainability analysis framework in guiding the debt restructuring process.  Implementation of the Common Framework must improve so that borrowers in debt distress can receive predictable, timely relief to restore debt sustainability. I urge all official bilateral and private creditors to work together to improve the process.  We must also work together to improve international coordination on debt restructuring for middle income countries.  Most urgently, I call upon all official bilateral creditors to quickly finalize the debt treatment for Zambia and reach consensus on debt treatments for Ethiopia, Ghana, Sri Lanka, and Suriname.  Enhancing debt transparency and management practices is critical for mitigating debt vulnerabilities and preventing future debt crises. It is also important that the IMF adapts its policies to adequately address the changed debt landscape and support restructurings. We look forward to forthcoming proposals for adapting the IMF’s financing assurances and Lending into Official Arrears policies to the evolving creditor landscape.  We urge all creditors to provide timely debt treatments, but in cases where this is delayed these proposed policy reforms can help to mitigate the risk of holdout creditors blocking debtor countries’ access to IMF financing and undermining their IMF-supported reform efforts.  Strong safeguards are an important aspect of these proposed reforms to IMF policies as they will help promote transparency and predictability in the debt restructuring process and fair burden sharing among all creditors.  The upcoming review of the IMF/World Bank Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework (LIC-DSF) will be another valuable tool for supporting successful debt restructurings.  We see scope for examining the impact of climate change on low-income countries’ debt sustainability, the challenges created by domestic debt risks, and the use of LIC- DSF thresholds in debt restructurings as key near-term priorities.  Addressing challenges related to economic governance, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) are critical to the IMF’s mission given the macro-criticality of these challenges in many jurisdictions, particularly as the IMF deepens its engagement with fragile and conflict-affected states.  We look forward to the completion of the review of the IMF’s AML/CFT strategy and call upon the IMF to step up its support to the Financial Action Task Force.The IMF Executive Board also needs to be more reflective of women’s voices where it continues to lag behind its peer institutions.  We call on the Board to develop medium-term, voluntary objectives for strengthening gender diversity amongst Executive Directors and Alternate Executive Directors, coupled with efforts to strengthen the pipeline of candidates for these positions.  Alongside our efforts to give greater voice to underrepresented regions, we must also create space for a greater share of women to join this most important platform.  Setting a higher standard for diversity and inclusion should not stop at the Board and senior management but must also filter down to the staff level at the IMF.  We welcome the strengthening of management accountability to achieve diversity and inclusion and remain committed to supporting the ongoing staff-led initiatives on this important issue."
44,,"October 10, 2023","Thank you for the introduction, and hello everyone. I’m glad to have the chance to visit UM6P. The World Bank is funding construction of the university’s newest branch. And the beautiful campus we’re at now reflects dedication to both achieving environmental sustainability and driving educational outcomes. It’s a perfect symbol of what I’ll be speaking about today.A key goal of multilateral engagement is to lift up the poorest and most vulnerable. To create the conditions so that all people can live prosperous and peaceful lives for generations to come.There has been some progress on the Sustainable Development Goals over the past decades, such as a substantial decrease in child mortality. But progress on too many other targets has been slow, stalled, or even reversed. This is in part due to global challenges that no country can solve on its own. Last year’s floods in Pakistan affected more than 30 million people and caused economic damage of over $30 billion, or around one-tenth of Pakistan’s GDP. The drought in Somalia killed more than 40,000 people and over 3 million livestock. Shocks like these often hit hardest countries and people who have less resources to prepare or to rebuild. And they pose risks to all our economies and to the future we seek.The good news is that we have tools at our disposal to not only course correct but also to realize new opportunities. The multilateral development banks, the International Monetary Fund, and the debt architecture, as well as private sector and domestic resources that can be mobilized, comprise a powerful international architecture. This architecture has changed over time to meet new challenges. And it must change again to meet the urgent global challenges of our time.That’s why, during last year’s Annual Meetings, I called for the evolution of the multilateral development banks. At this one-year mark, we can see the tremendous progress we’ve made. We’ve aligned around a common vision and formed a broad coalition to demand the reforms that are needed. Evolution is now high on the G20’s agenda, and the Indonesian and Indian presidencies have played key roles. We’ve heard the clarion calls of leaders from Prime Minister Mottley of Barbados to President Ruto of Kenya. And at the World Bank itself, we have a new President, Ajay Banga, who has already begun turning this vision into action.While we started with a focus on the World Bank, we’re also bringing this agenda to the regional development banks. We’re positioning the International Monetary Fund to continue fulfilling its own critical mandate. And we’re pushing to make the debt architecture work better and faster.In my remarks today, I’ll reflect on what we’ve accomplished in just one year and on what we need to do to keep the momentum going. I’ll also highlight the concrete differences these changes will make, for emerging markets and developing countries, and for all of us.  The World Bank was formed in the aftermath of World War II. Its initial focus was on supporting recovery from the war, which is why its first loan was to France. But it expanded its mission, lending, and geographic reach. And in 2013, it formalized a new mission in the Twin Goals: to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity.A decade later, the global challenges of climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict threaten the achievement of these Twin Goals. So, addressing these challenges needs to be an integral part of the work of development institutions. And change starts with mission. This week in Marrakech, the World Bank Board of Governors will endorse a new vision to “end poverty on a livable planet.” This vision reflects a broader consensus. Last month at the inaugural Africa Climate Summit, for example, African leaders committed to integrating climate agendas into national plans “to assure their full potential to support sustainable development is realized.” It’s become common sense that addressing climate change and other global challenges is key to achieving development.To have impact, a new vision must drive new actions. Here, too, we’ve made progress. The World Bank is putting in place operational changes so that it can better address global challenges.To combat climate change, the World Bank is improving the analytics and diagnostic tools that guide its work. Enhanced country climate and development reports will link climate change and development priorities, positioning governments and development partners to design projects that both maximize development results and increase climate resilience and adaptation. An expanded crisis response toolkit will include tools such as access to enhanced catastrophe insurance to enable responding to disasters. And there will be broader changes to integrate climate across the World Bank’s operations. This is just common sense. An agricultural project that is not designed to withstand climate-related shocks and longer-term stresses—like droughts, shortened seasons, and erratic weather patterns—will fall short of reaching its intended outcomes. But a project with drought-resilient crops and more efficient water use will lead to increased yields, improving livelihoods and keeping populations food secure.The World Bank will also provide more support for increasing resilience to global health emergencies. COVID-19 caused a shock to education globally. Support to strengthen digital infrastructure could enable a quick pivot to remote learning, keeping development targets on track even in the midst of crisis. These investments, too, are common sense.And to address fragility and conflict, the World Bank will increase support through projects that improve access to basic services and livelihoods for refugee populations around conflict zones in ways that also benefit host populations, for example. Other projects will attack the root causes of conflict, such as youth unemployment. Again, this is common sense: the only way for the World Bank to meet its goals given the challenges we face.Work has already started on principles for using concessional finance in a targeted way to provide more support for activities like these—ones that address global challenges. And the work ahead includes finalizing the framework for allocating these concessional resources.We will also need to equip World Bank staff to deliver. This will require internal process improvements that increase agility and speed up decision-making without sacrificing quality, as well as cultural change to accelerate private sector mobilization and responsible risk-taking.Delivering on this more complex agenda—one that does justice to the mutually reinforcing goals of achieving poverty reduction, driving economic growth, and tackling global challenges—requires boosting the World Bank’s financial capacity.We’ve already made significant progress. At the Spring Meetings, Governors endorsed reforms that will unlock $50 billion in additional financing capacity at the World Bank over the next decade. Two weeks ago, the Asian Development Bank updated its Capital Adequacy Framework. This will unlock $100 billion—meaning a 40% increase in its annual new commitments capacity. Across the system, these reforms and others under active consideration would mean a total of at least $200 billion in additional capacity.We expect more progress very soon. This week, Governors will endorse a shareholder portfolio guarantee platform that gives shareholders a new way to contribute and they will lay the groundwork for the issuance of hybrid capital, a key measure to optimize balance sheets. The platform is part of the United States’ proposal for shareholders to increase World Bank concessional financing capacity to address global challenges. President Biden has requested funding that would enable the World Bank to provide $27 billion for projects that address climate change, pandemics, and fragility, and to support immediate crisis response in the poorest countries. The G20 has committed to mobilizing more resources. And other countries are making announcements on how they will boost capacity as well.But MDB financing alone will never suffice to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. So, we also need to do much better to engage private capital and mobilize domestic resources. We need the MDBs to establish concrete private capital mobilization targets and incentives for staff to meet those targets. At the World Bank, lending, guarantee, and insurance instruments offered by IFC and MIGA need to be expanded and better utilized, and we need to find new ways to smartly manage foreign exchange risk. The World Bank should also invest more in project preparation and structuring and should release Global Emerging Markets data so that private investors can better understand the actual risk and opportunity of investing in these markets. And it should provide additional support to countries to put in place the right policies to grow healthy private sectors and local capital markets—and to increase domestic resource mobilization.Looking ahead, we have asked MDB presidents to prioritize the major next step of incorporating a prudent share of callable capital—the commitment from shareholders to step in in extreme circumstances—into their capital adequacy frameworks. This will require commitment and effort from shareholders, MDB management, and credit rating agencies. But it is work well worth doing to expand the financial capacity of the entire MDB system.The regional development banks are also a crucial part of the evolution agenda. Regional development banks have unique expertise on the priorities and needs of the regions they serve. And they can work together with the World Bank and others as a system to increase impact.We have exciting examples already. The World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank recently picked up the call for evolution and launched a partnership to work more closely together in Latin America and the Caribbean, including on joint work to strengthen resilience to natural disasters. The United States has led the call for a capital increase for IDB Invest’s renewed vision—IDB 2.0—predicated on an originate-to-share approach, which would mean bringing the private sector into investments earlier and more strategically. The African Development Bank is the first multilateral development bank to create a framework for hybrid capital and is pursuing its first transaction. And AfDB is also supporting Africa50’s recent launch of Africa’s first asset recycling program, designed to free up government funds for infrastructure investments by involving the private sector.Development banks are only one part of the international financial architecture, so we have also turned our attention to the IMF. Like the development banks, the IMF has undertaken reforms over decades, in its case to fulfill its mandate of overseeing the stability of the international monetary system. This moment demands additional change at the IMF as well.Our efforts start with making sure the IMF has sufficient resources. An equiproportional increase in quotas will shore up the IMF’s finances, reducing its dependence on borrowed resources and allowing for larger lending packages within the set access limits and where appropriate. We also continue to call for more support for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, the IMF’s concessional financing facility. The PRGT drastically increased its lending during the pandemic, deploying funds to meet urgent balance of payment needs. More recently, it has lent critical support to countries such as Ghana and Zambia that are undertaking reforms in the context of debt restructuring processes. Without additional funding, the PRGT will not be able to support continued high demand. The United States has already contributed to the PRGT subsidy account and has called on the IMF to utilize internal resources so that all members are supporting low-income countries. And we have asked Congress to authorize the United States to lend $21 billion to IMF Trust Funds that support low-income countries or help build resilience.Beyond securing resources, we continue to believe the IMF should fulfill its core mission through providing sound policy advice, capacity development, and financing. Perhaps the most important work the IMF can undertake is to support a country to find sustainable macroeconomic footing through deploying a combination of these tools. For example, the IMF’s capacity building efforts are helping drive increases in debt transparency. Like with investments in climate, these changes have impacts far beyond the country directly receiving support. They help channel private financial resources to meet global challenges and underpin global financial stability.And alongside resources and fulfilling its core mission, we are exploring ways to directly increase the voice of emerging markets and developing countries in the IMF. We’ve proposed adding another Deputy Managing Director to have two deputies representing emerging markets and low-income countries, instead of one that represents both. And we are also beginning to engage with members on the potential of adding a third Executive Board chair representing sub-Saharan Africa. We also support a quota formula that better reflects the global economy, but change on this can only happen within an agreed-on framework based on shared principles.I’ll end by turning to the debt architecture. Public debt has been steadily rising for decades and the pandemic caused it to sharply spike. The portion of low-income countries in or at high risk of debt distress has doubled since 2015. This is inextricably linked to the challenges I’ve already discussed. Debt poses risks to development and financial sustainability. When Ghana sought an IMF program and debt treatment under the Common Framework last year, a shocking 47 percent of government revenues were going to service debt. These were funds that were unavailable to invest in preventing the next climate shock or strengthening health systems.Over the past year, we’ve made progress on debt restructuring in particular cases. For example, Zambia reached a deal with foreign government creditors in June. But it took far too long to get there. The past year has also seen uptake of new creative solutions, such as climate-resilient debt clauses. These clauses pause debt repayments in the event of climate disaster. This means that when disaster hits, a borrower country will be able to spend much-needed funds on emergency response and recovery, exactly when such funds are most crucial. And investors will still get paid back, just on a later timeline. The World Bank will be piloting these clauses as part of its expanded crisis response toolkit.Looking ahead, we need to continue efforts to quickly resolve debt distress in other cases. We also need to accelerate our broader work to advance reforms at the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable. An architecture that allows debt distress to be resolved quickly and predictably will allow countries to restart growth, make investments that improve lives, and contribute to the global economy.We are not where we should be on the Sustainable Development Goals, and the global challenges we all face make achieving sustained progress even harder. But we have a pathway out: through making bold reforms to the international financial architecture and then using it fully. I’m proud of how much we’ve accomplished in one year. And I believe there will be even deeper collaboration and more widespread commitment as we continue this work, including as Brazil assumes the G20 presidency. But we know there is much more to be done.The Annual Meetings have been held in Africa only once since 1947. That was 50 years ago, in 1973 in Nairobi. It was another moment of change in the world and for the World Bank. Here, on the African continent, one month after the African Union became a formal member of the G20, we are defining the course forward at another key moment. We need an international financial architecture that lives up to the promise of multilateral engagement. The past year has made me hopeful that we will jointly leverage the tools and shared political will we have to bring about a better world. Thank you."
45,,"October 10, 2023","I want to thank the Minister, and local, and school officials for inviting me to visit this very impressive school. And, to see all that is being done to quickly ensure that students in areas so badly affected by the earthquake are able to continue their education. This is an incredibly impressive effort, affecting over ninety-five percent of students who are in schools in areas that have suffered extreme damage and it shows the importance that Morocco attaches to education, and an understanding of the importance of education in economic development. It really is a testament to see all that’s been done, and so quickly, through the resilience of the Moroccan people in being able to adjust so quickly and adapt after an unspeakable tragedy. I want to say that the hearts of the American people go out to our friends in Morocco. We send our condolences and are grieving for your loss. And we stand ready to help in any way that is helpful as you go about these rebuilding efforts.In the midst of all Morocco has suffered, it really is a testament to the resilience of this community that you are able to host in the gathering as large as the international meetings of the IMF and World Bank that are taking place here this week. We are very grateful that you’re able to host us, it’s something we’ve been looking forward to for a number of years, but please know that as we meet this week, first and foremost in our minds and our hearts will be all that Morocco has suffered. Our best wishes and support that goes out to the Moroccan people and the importance that we attach as we discuss the work of international institutions to stand ready to help Morocco and other countries that can be affected by such severe shocks.So, thank you again. This is such an impressive effort, and really shows the values that Morocco stands for, and the resilience that you have as a community. Thank you."
46,,"September 30, 2023","I applaud Congress for moving to avoid a reckless and unnecessary government shutdown. America has made remarkable economic progress over the last two and a half years, with unemployment near historic lows, inflation declining, and robust economic growth. We should be working to support our economic progress — as President Biden has done with generational investments in infrastructure, semiconductors, and advanced manufacturing — instead of jeopardizing it with dangerous political brinksmanship.The Continuing Resolution passed by the House and Senate adheres to the bipartisan budget agreement President Biden struck earlier this year, which cuts deficits by more than a trillion dollars over the decade. Thankfully, this legislation will continue funding for the government, and it advances key priorities put forward by the President including critical disaster relief.President Biden and I remain deeply committed to ensuring that Ukraine has the support it needs to defend its people and its territorial integrity. Our support for Ukraine advances America’s national security and it bolsters a rules-based international system that benefits America and the world as a whole. In particular, it is vital that we sustain the economic assistance which has played a key role in enabling Ukraine’s brave resistance on the frontlines of this war. Our allies and partners have stepped up with tens of billions of dollars in commitments for economic and budgetary assistance. We have worked closely with both those partners and the Ukrainian government to support economic reforms and promote the effective use of our assistance. America must — and will — continue to stand up for freedom and our core interests by supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes in the face of Putin’s barbaric war. The Administration, and I personally, will fight for that support moving forward."
47,,"September 29, 2023","I’d like to begin by speaking about the sad news of Senator Feinstein’s passing. Senator Feinstein was a giant in the Senate, a champion for Californians, and a trailblazer for women. Our nation is indebted to her for her life of service, and my thoughts are with her family at this time.I’d also like to address the potential looming government shutdown. When I left Washington this morning, it was still unclear whether Congress would pass legislation in time to avoid a dangerous and unnecessary shutdown. The Senate is advancing a bipartisan short-term funding bill. It is crucial that House Republicans also do their jobs and move quickly to keep the government open and adequately fund key priorities, as they agreed to in May.Over the past two and a half years, we have undergone a historic economic recovery. Unemployment is near historic lows and inflation is down substantially from its peak. We’re also making crucial investments for the long term. The failure of House Republicans to act responsibly would hurt American families and cause economic headwinds that could undermine the progress we’re making. A shutdown would impact many key government functions – from loans to farmers and small businesses, to food and workplace safety inspections, to Head Start programs for children. And it could delay major infrastructure improvements. As I’ll show in my remarks today, these projects change the lives and livelihoods of Americans across the country and build our economic strength.  I’m glad to be in Savannah today to explain why these projects are so important. The Port of Savannah looks very different than it did two years ago. And it’s just one example of what’s been happening, at a very fast pace, across the country.When President Biden came into office, the Administration faced the shock of COVID-19. One year later, Russia invaded Ukraine. That was another unexpected shock. We also faced structural challenges, including low productivity growth and entrenched income inequality, as well as regional divergences. We responded with the American Rescue Plan, and over the past two and a half years, we’ve succeeded in driving a historic economic recovery. We’ve also been building the economy we need for the long term, including through a trifecta of legislation: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s working. As one example, since January 2021, our policies and investments have led companies to commit over $500 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments.There are many important aspects of the President’s Investing in America agenda, all rooted in what I call modern supply-side economics: growing our economy’s long-run productive capacity while addressing inequality and climate change. Today, I’ll focus my remarks on one way we’re doing this: through investments in infrastructure, like those being made here in Savannah. Until the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, public investments in infrastructure had fallen each decade since the 1960s. Much of our country’s infrastructure was decades old. We felt it when we slowed down on crumbling highways on our way to work or driving our children to school. We saw it in the communities across the country that lacked access to the reliable, fast internet that participation in the digital economy requires. And we knew it wasn’t prepared for one of the greatest challenges we face globally. Climate change poses tremendous risks to our already vulnerable infrastructure. And we need investments in green infrastructure to reduce emissions and achieve a clean energy future. In my remarks today, I’ll speak about how investments in infrastructure change how we live and work, and with that, our economy. These investments fuel long-term economic growth, build economic resilience, and increase economic opportunity. They are, very simply, good economics. And that’s why they’re at the heart of our Investing in America agenda. I’ll start with the impact of infrastructure on economic growth. And I’ll use an example that’s relatable to many of us. In cities from Atlanta to Chicago, roads are congested from traffic for upwards of four hours a day on average. In other cities, this average is closer to six. This cuts into work time and makes our schedules less predictable. Investments in infrastructure change this, making us more productive. And individual productivity gains, when aggregated, have a significant impact on economic growth. According to one analysis, a 10 percent increase in public capital investments in core physical infrastructure increases productivity by more than 2 percent. And due in large part to this productivity increase, public investments in infrastructure grow national output, by as much as 1.2 percent in the long run for every 10 percent increase in public capital investment. Public investment in infrastructure spurs private investment, magnifying impacts. These investments create jobs. Investments in broadband, for example, demand new jobs in installation, maintenance, and repair. And these are good-paying jobs, many of them for Americans who don’t have college degrees.The impact on growth is one reason this Administration is investing $110 billion to repair roads and bridges. Billions more are being spent on passenger rail and airports. And $17 billion in new public investments has enabled port infrastructure and waterway projects across the country. Here in Georgia, funding will help repair the almost 300 bridges and over 2,000 miles of highway in poor condition, as just one example.But economic growth is only a part of the story. The COVID-19 pandemic not only affected our health and well-being. It also revealed tremendous challenges to our economic resilience. In the initial months of the pandemic, Americans across the country walked into grocery stores to find that they lacked basic essentials. We waited for shipments of everyday items that never arrived. We watched prices for key goods increase. In response, the Administration acted quickly, launching a Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force to address short-term supply bottlenecks. The Task Force worked closely with state and local governments and private businesses to get the most we could out of existing infrastructure. The country’s largest ports shifted to full-time operations, newly utilizing off-peak hours. The federal Department of Transportation enabled pop-up container yards here in Georgia, freeing up crucial space close to the port of Savannah. These early actions contributed to goods flowing more smoothly and helped mitigate a driver of higher prices. We’re still seeing the positive impacts. In May, the global supply chain pressure index—which measures supply chain disruptions—fell to its lowest point since 2008, after having peaked in December 2021.But the shock of COVID-19 comes alongside persistent, ongoing shocks from our changing climate. In the early months of this Administration, a freeze left more than 10 million Texans without electricity. Last month’s Hurricane Idalia destroyed homes that weren’t prepared for the impact. This means short-term actions need to be complemented by building long-term resilience. This too depends on infrastructure. In anticipation of a world with increasingly severe and frequent weather events, we are making investments that ensure we are better prepared for a next pandemic or climate-related event. This includes investments to bolster grid resilience, such as over $17 million to prevent outages in Georgia. We’re investing to prevent floods from destroying homes and to rehabilitate or remove aging dams. And we’re supporting pre-disaster resilience.Resilience is not just about adaptation, however. It’s about reducing environmental damage and building the clean energy future we need. At airports, funding is supporting projects that increase energy efficiency. At ports, it’s going to reduce or eliminate toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. The fact that over a quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation means investing in clean vehicles is also a priority. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law includes $7.5 billion to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, tackling a longtime barrier to the EV market’s growth. And the incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act complement these investments. For example, the IRA provides a tax credit of up to $7,500 for new clean vehicles, and another tax credit for EV charging stations. Like other investments in infrastructure, investments in EV manufacturing are creating good-paying, middle-class jobs. And targeted programs such as the Department of Energy’s Industrial Assessment Centers ensure workers have pathways into them.Finally, infrastructure investment is crucial to increasing economic opportunity for all Americans. Today, the internet is as essential for many Americans as plumbing or electricity. Yet more than 8.5 million households and small businesses across the country have no high-speed internet infrastructure. Investing in broadband infrastructure therefore not only fuels growth and builds resilience. It broadens economic opportunity, enabling children to reach higher levels of educational attainment and their parents to apply for jobs and run modern businesses. In Georgia, over 300,000 homes and small businesses have not had access to high-speed infrastructure. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the state will receive $1.3 billion to expand access to all. Lead removal is another example of how infrastructure investments can expand economic opportunity. Millions of American households get their water through lead pipes and service lines. So do 400,000 schools and childcare facilities. Lead exposure can cause cognitive impairment, threatening outcomes like educational attainment. And, like with access to broadband, lead pipe distribution maps onto racial and income disparities. In Georgia, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is allocating $95 million for lead pipe and service line replacement and almost $100 million for safe drinking water. These investments enable healthier and more productive lives, benefiting our whole economy.Across a broad range of areas, we’ve also been designing these investments to reach those who need them most. Take the $3 billion for the Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program, which provides grants for high-speed internet on tribal lands. Or the Department of Agriculture’s Reconnect Program, focused on rural areas. Or the fact that Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are enhanced for investments in coal communities and other communities that historically have relied on the fossil fuel industry for employment. Over 80 percent of IRA-related investments are in counties with lower college graduation rates than the national average. These policy choices not only help those they directly benefit. They also increase the broader economic impact of these investments. For example, adding employment opportunities in distressed places generates substantially greater economic benefits than similarly increasing opportunities elsewhere. It’s exciting to be here in Savannah at the nation’s third busiest port. This port’s ability to receive and ship goods effectively and efficiently matters tremendously for our country’s economic strength. Deepening the Savannah Harbor will be transformative in enabling more heavily-loaded vessels to enter and exit the harbor more easily. And $48 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will support environmental monitoring for the next decade. Estimates project that every dollar invested in this project will bring about $7 in benefits to our economy.The changes happening here, and those across the country, also depend on strong local and state support. The Georgia Ports Authority was a key player in troubleshooting critical supply chain issues early in the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to spearhead ambitious developments. Elected officials like Senator Reverend Warnock and Senator Ossoff have played an important role. And across the country, from upgrading highways to supporting the battery belt emerging in the Midwest and South, American workers are the main enablers of progress. Building the future we need depends on each of us continuing this work. Our collective efforts are ensuring Americans can live healthy and productive lives. And they’re shaping a new future for our children and generations to come. We’ll see this future in small day-to-day changes: the roads we drive on, the cars we drive, the water we drink. And we’ll see it in much larger changes. We’re boosting our country’s economic strength and competitiveness. We’re improving its ability to withstand the next freeze or hurricane. And we’re creating good-paying jobs, including for those who have been too often left behind. This is the impact of modern supply-side economics – and President Biden’s focus on infrastructure is no exception. "

The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

52,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
53,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

54,,"September 21, 2023","Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the first U.S. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment Investor Forum. And to Secretary Blinken for his introductory remarks. I’m also glad to be here alongside President Banga, who has been leading so much crucial work.When President Biden and the G7 launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment last June, they set a target of mobilizing $600 billion for global infrastructure investments over five years. The United States plans to mobilize one-third of that, or $200 billion. Alongside financial resources, the Treasury Department is working to accelerate the delivery of transformative infrastructure projects, through this Partnership, as well as through Just Energy Transition Partnerships and our broader work on evolving the multilateral development banks. The projects that result will fuel the energy transition, provide basic services, and drive sustainable and inclusive growth.This is because infrastructure provides an excellent return on investment. A 2021 meta-study by the Global Infrastructure Hub found that every dollar invested in infrastructure produces a 150% return in economic output, after two to five years. And a large body of evidence shows that infrastructure investment increases productivity, benefitting both firms and households. When done right, infrastructure investment raises long-term growth and increases social inclusivity.Return on investment is one reason we’re focused on quality infrastructure. With many countries facing fiscal constraints, every dollar—or peso, rand, or rupee—counts. We need projects that meet the most pressing needs of our partners over the long term. And we need projects that respect environmental, social and technical standards, including having buy-in from local communities.We are partnering with governments in need of investment to create the right policy environments. This a core tenet, for example, of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships, or JETPs. In the Indonesia JETP, Treasury is working with a network of banks to identify policy barriers to private investment and discuss solutions with the Government of Indonesia that would unlock significant amounts of private investment in Indonesia’s energy transition.And Treasury is also working to tackle other barriers to investment. We know that the lack of investment-ready projects is a challenge, so we are seeking to increase funding for project preparation. We’ve also been helping to play a matchmaking role between governments, investors, and the opportunities we and others identify. We’re seeing exciting opportunities. PGI partners are hard at work on the Trans-African Corridor, and on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, which was announced just this month at the G20 Summit.The multilateral development banks also have a crucial role to play in supporting policy change, providing risk mitigation instruments, and developing bankable projects. This is one of Treasury’s priorities in our ongoing work to evolve the multilateral development banks. Last year, I asked the MDBs to set ambitious private capital mobilization targets and to implement consistent data reporting to track their progress and speed up adoption of impactful solutions. We are also asking the MDBs to assess their operating and financing models for opportunities to enhance mobilization, and to align staff incentives to reward interventions that increase private investment. We are looking forward to the results of President Banga’s Private Sector Investment Lab, which will help us identify “what works” for achieving better integration between the MDBs and private investors. And at the upcoming Annual Meetings, I expect to endorse a robust package of reforms that will embed addressing global challenges into the institution’s DNA and further increase its ability to make investments in infrastructure that boosts countries’ resilience.As Secretary Blinken highlighted, convenings like today’s roundtable are an important way for public and private leaders with diverse perspectives to exchange feedback. I previously met with members of the Investor Leadership Network in Paris in June, and I look forward to upcoming meetings with public and private partners. Today, we hope to discuss not only what the opportunities and challenges are but also how you’re approaching them and how we can further support you. The power of these convenings is when they lead to renewed commitment and action. We should determine where exactly we’re making progress, where the gaps are, and how to drive more progress."
55,,"September 20, 2023","Thank you, Chrystia, for your kind words and your leadership. And thank you to the Atlantic Council. I am honored to receive this award – and to be among such distinguished fellow recipients.  When I was born, the world was still recovering from the devastation of the Great Depression and the Second World War. From the rubble of these crises, the United States and many other countries charted a post-war course premised on a conviction: that each nation’s stability and growth depended on our collective security and prosperity.  This is equally if not more true today. I took office in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, which underscored just how interconnected we all are. From the beginning of the Administration, we made clear that American isolationism and retrenchment were over. And we set forth a new guiding principle: America is strongest when we engage with the world. As my nation’s chief economic diplomat, I have since worked to faithfully apply that principle.When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, we witnessed the determination of the Ukrainian people as they fought for their lives and freedom, and for the values we all share. And we knew we had to support them with a decisive response. As we look back on the past year and a half of the war, it’s clear that many of our actions so far would have been impossible to undertake if any country were attempting them alone. Our unprecedented multilateral sanctions regime and novel price cap on Russian oil exports are effective in pressuring Russia only because we acted as a global coalition. And I believe the global economy is in a better place than many of us thought it would be a year ago due to our collective actions. This commitment to multilateralism should drive our continued efforts to exert more pressure on Russia to end its unjust war, and to support the Ukrainian people. And it should shape our actions in crises to come. Robust engagement with the world is not confined to moments of crisis, however. It’s required, for example, to hold off the steady march of climate change, which is affecting communities across America and around the world. To invest in a global health system that can prevent and withstand the next pandemic, avoiding the immense human toll and economic damage like that we saw from COVID-19. To create a fairer international tax system that ends a race to the bottom and benefits working people around the world. So, we’ve helped lead efforts to establish a pandemic fund and to align over 130 countries on a global minimum tax. We’ve put forward a new vision for development in the 21st century focused on global challenges and collaborated with others to evolve the multilateral development banks to make good on it. We’re also working to stabilize relations with China by seeking a healthy economic relationship that benefits both sides and enables cooperation on global challenges, while protecting our vital national security interests. In sum, we’ve engaged with the world, including through committed coalition-building, and with a view to building the global economy we need for the long term.In today’s world, we’re in it together. And we have to go at it together if we want to make our nations and the world safer, healthier, and more prosperous. Thank you again for this honor. I look forward to the collective work ahead of us."
56,,"September 20, 2023","Indeed, just earlier this month, President Biden and General Secretary Trong took the historic step of upgrading the United States–Vietnam relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.This reflects the remarkable strides in our mutual understanding and trust in recent years and underscores our commitment to deepening cooperation in the years to come. It also presents new opportunities to jointly promote innovation-driven inclusive economic growth.Since we normalized relations in 1995, Vietnam has become a close economic partner, with our two-way trade reaching record highs last year and the United States serving as Vietnam’s largest export market.The Biden-Harris Administration views Vietnam as a key partner in our “friendshoring” approach to deepen integration with a broad set of partners and allies to create diverse, resilient, and sustainable supply chains in key industries. We are encouraged by the growing investments that companies are making in Vietnam and recognize Vietnam's tremendous potential as a major player in the semiconductor industry.I also welcome your leadership on the clean energy transition. Along with my International Partners Group colleagues, I have been heartened to see momentum towards developing a Resource Mobilization Plan under the Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP. I look forward to talking more about Vietnam’s path forward."
57,,"September 19, 2023","Thank you, President Banga, for your words of support and introduction. Thank you also to Director-General Tedros, Minister Sabin, and the Pandemic Fund Secretariat for all you’ve done to get us here. And hello everyone. I’m glad to mark this occasion – the one-year anniversary of the Pandemic Fund – with all of you tonight. Over the past few years, COVID-19 has made us confront the tremendous human and economic costs of pandemics. And, like with other recent global health events, it underscored the critical gaps in pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. So, when the G20 High-Level Independent Panel called for a new financing mechanism to address these gaps in June 2021, the international community came together and acted. President Biden echoed the Panel’s call at the Global COVID-19 Summit in September 2021 and announced an initial U.S. contribution. Then, under the Italian and Indonesian G20 Presidencies, finance and health ministries worked to launch the Pandemic Fund in record time. In the year since this launch, the Pandemic Fund has raised nearly $2 billion from 25 countries and three philanthropies. And this past July, from its first call for proposals, the Pandemic Fund awarded $338 million. It will leverage an additional $2 billion in co-financing from implementing entities and co-investor countries. Funding will go to 37 countries, including for a project in Zambia that will strengthen early warning systems through integrating public health data into an electronic surveillance and response platform. I saw how important this is firsthand when I visited the new emergency operations center for monitoring health threats in Lusaka in January. Another project supports 12 countries in the Caribbean on regional coordination, including through pandemic simulation exercises. These and the many other approved projects will tangibly improve our collective ability to prevent pandemics and to better withstand those that could still occur. As I’ve said before, the Pandemic Fund is truly a model for multilateralism: Many countries have worked quickly and effectively to address this global challenge. We should all be proud of what we’ve done. But I also want to stress that now is not the time for complacency. More work is needed to realize the Pandemic Fund’s full potential and to strengthen global health capacities.First, we know the Pandemic Fund will need more resources: $10 billion per year over the next five years, as called for by the High-Level Independent Panel. The U.S. has already contributed $700 million. And we are requesting an additional $500 million from Congress as part of President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2024 budget. We urge other countries to increase contributions. And we also need to explore more sustainable financing models. I’m glad the Board of the Pandemic Fund will focus on that in the coming year. Second, the Pandemic Fund doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Its success will depend on the success of broader efforts underway to strengthen the global health and finance architecture. One such effort is our ongoing work to evolve the multilateral development banks so that they have the tools to better help countries assess and manage pandemic-related risks, among other global challenges. This includes ramping up investments in regional and global projects to address pandemic preparedness and response gaps. It also includes integrating pandemic surveillance and preparedness measures as part of health projects wherever possible, as health security requires a holistic approach. And it includes considering how the MDBs can best complement and catalyze other sources of financing.The United States is also supporting ongoing work in Geneva on the Pandemic Accord and amendments to the International Health Regulations. And we welcome the work of the G20 Finance-Health Task Force to deepen our understanding of the interplay between health and economic shocks. The Task Force’s work to help identify financing gaps and to develop a comprehensive response playbook for pandemics and routine pandemic stress tests will be especially crucial.  Again, congratulations to the many of you who have been instrumental in creating and operationalizing the Pandemic Fund. We’ve accomplished a lot very quickly. But there’s much more to do, to strengthen the Pandemic Fund and to continue building the global health architecture people around the world need and deserve. COVID-19 destroyed the lives and disrupted the livelihoods of too many. We cannot eliminate the risk of another pandemic. But we can make pandemics less likely and ensure that, if they do occur, we are better prepared for them. Thank you all for being here. Our collective work saves lives, preserves livelihoods, and fuels economies, and tonight is a call to recommit ourselves to taking it forward. "
58,,"September 19, 2023",
59,,"September 19, 2023","I’d like to start by expressing my appreciation for the work you and your firms are doing on climate – particularly the support you provide to your clients and portfolio companies to both better manage the risks and take advantage of the opportunities associated with climate change. The steps you’ve been taking are significant.Later today, I’ll give remarks on the release of Treasury’s Principles for Net-Zero Financing and Investment, which we have just published. These Principles lay out best practices for financial institutions that have made or are thinking about making net-zero commitments.Following the Principles is, of course, voluntary, but many of those in this room are taking or have already taken actions consistent with some of the best practices they highlight. And for those that haven’t, we think they can be useful in clarifying what to consider.We know that every financial institution is different. And your clients and portfolio companies are diverse. For this reason, the Principles highlight approaches – such as developing transition plans – that are both rigorous and flexible.All of this is in service of achieving shared goals: navigating both risks and economic opportunities as the United States builds the clean energy economy of the future. Today, I hope we can discuss the challenges and opportunities your firms are facing as we work to realize those goals."
60,,"September 18, 2023","Thank you all for joining me. I want to start by thanking the Lagos Business School for graciously hosting us. I’m glad to be here today representing President Biden and the United State Government. My visit this week comes on the back of those by many other officials in the Biden Administration, including Secretary of State Blinken. President Biden is committed to a strong U.S.-Nigeria relationship built on shared values and mutual benefit. Our Administration recognizes that your economic success is not only important to the approximately 200 million people who call Nigeria home; it is important to the region, the continent, and the global economy. Nigeria is, as you know, the largest economy in Africa and will be the fourth most populous country in the world by 2050. Nigeria’s economic and social impact can be felt well beyond your borders with a diaspora that has spread across the world, bringing with them the unbounded creativity and innovation that you find in every city and village. As a child of the diaspora, I am humbled to be standing here in front of you as the U.S. Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. More than four decades ago, my parents left a very different Nigeria to get an education in search of opportunity for their young family. They raised us with a deep and abiding love for Nigerian culture and the struggles of a people that fought to be free of colonialism and the yolk of dictatorship. A people filled with so much potential but with too few opportunities. In so many ways Nigeria is a different country than the one we left more than forty years ago, but progress on expanding economic opportunity has come more slowly than any of us hoped.This is a critical moment in Nigeria, where decisive actions by your government and the determination and shared effort of the Nigerian people can create the changes needed to unlock the unrealized opportunity of Africa’s most populous country.Nigeria’s greatest resource is not oil, it is the Nigerian people. Nigerians have built leading companies around the world like the Dangote Group, Globacom, and Zenith Bank. Nigerians have made significant contributions to culture from Wole Soyinka to Chinua Achebe. Nigerian music and films are heard and watched around the world, and I’m excited to tour Ogidi Studios this evening to see one of many places where this art is made. Today one of Nigeria’s greatest opportunities is the fact that around three in five Nigerians are below the age of 25, creating the possibility for Nigeria to reap a tremendous “demographic dividend,” as the proportion of working people in the country grows. That possibility lies with you, the students here at the Lagos Business School. Creating jobs and access to opportunity for the tens of thousands of students and executives that come through here, and your peers all over this country, is essential to Nigeria’s success.In addition to being on the right side of demographics, Nigeria is also blessed with an array of natural resources and innovative companies. It is clear from my conversations with investors and foreign companies that they are eager to invest in Nigeria to help grow a diversified economy that can meet your needs. We know that with the right macroeconomic framework, Nigeria can be a destination of choice for foreign direct investment.While demographics and capital can fuel a Nigerian economic boom, small and medium sized enterprises will sustain your growth. There are more than 40 million micro, small, and medium sized business in the country, which employ more than 80 percent of Nigerians. These businesses represent the beating heart of the Nigerian economy. In order for these businesses to thrive, they need government policy to go from being the problem to providing solutions.Nigerians are at the heart of the innovation that is blossoming all over Africa. From arts to technology, the economy is more diverse today than even a few years ago. Tomorrow, I’m looking forward to touring Vibranium Valley and meeting with leaders in venture capital, fintech, healthcare, and more. These firms have the ability to be drivers of growth here in Nigeria, but they require an ecosystem of public-private partnership that fosters investment.The Tinubu Administration and the people I’ve met with – from students to entrepreneurs to major business leaders – all share a common understanding of the challenges and opportunities Nigeria faces. The question now is how to forge a path forward that creates prosperity for the Nigerian people. I am here to say that the United States stands ready and eager to partner with the Nigerian people and government in your quest to build a better future. Before I talk about specific areas in which we are keen to partner, let me first take a minute to discuss why I have faith in our partnership. Our countries have enjoyed a decades-long relationship that has only grown since democracy returned to Nigeria in 1999. The heart of this relationship is people. America is home to over half a million Nigerian-born American citizens and permanent residents. This vast diaspora community brings rich culture, a penchant for entrepreneurship, and wide-ranging economic and social contributions. Thousands of Nigerians study each year in the United States, including through educational exchanges like the Fulbright and Humphrey fellowship programs and the Mandela Washington Fellowship that seeks to foster the next generation of young African leaders.Thousands of United States citizens call Nigeria home. We also have a number of American companies from different sectors that have made significant investments in Nigeria, from Google to General Electric.In addition to our countries’ trade, the U.S. government provided Nigeria with over $1 billion in assistance last year, helping to support Nigerians with access to health care and reducing food insecurity.There are many reasons why the United States is committed to this partnership – from our people-to-people relationships to our shared values to our common economic and security interests. I want to spend the remainder of my remarks highlighting some of the steps needed for the type of growth that creates economic opportunity for the Nigerian people.First, Nigeria needs a stable Naira. You stop into any small business or market, and you will hear shop owners and customers bemoaning the lack of a stable currency. Unifying Nigeria’s foreign exchange rates will create the kind of macroeconomic stability that is essential to attracting foreign investment. We commend the difficult steps your government has already taken to accomplish this goal. The path to unification is not easy, but going backwards would be even worse. Second, the government needs to articulate and implement a fiscal strategy that will provide the resources to make critical investments. I recognize the decision to end fuel subsidies is hard for many Nigerian households, but it was an important early step to create resources the government can use to invest in physical and digital infrastructure, education, and a strong small business environment.There is nowhere this need is greater than the agriculture industry, which despite the digital revolution taking place remains Nigeria’s top employer. Its full potential is held back by issues like access to fertilizer, limited use of new technology, access to water and land, the availability of credit, and high market entry costs.The need for economic reform does not demand indifference to the pain caused by this transition. This is why partners like the World Bank and African Development Bank are committed to working with your government to provide resources and advice to help smooth this transition for the Nigerian people.The third factor for growth is a rooting out of corruption and the perception of corruption in the business environment. I know the Nigerian people are willing to make sacrifices in the service of progress but have a legitimate fear that corruption and mismanagement will dash their hopes that the benefits of these reforms will enrich the people rather than the powerful. I know that Nigerians agree with Wole Soyinka that “it is not fair to those who fight corruption that they have to fight the aggressiveness, the impunity of the corrupt.” Creating economic opportunity will require a government-driven effort that addresses these fears by shining a light on corruption, holding people accountable, and taking meaningful steps to improve the business climate.For example, Nigeria is a hotbed for digital entrepreneurship. Taking simple steps like moving government functions online, so Nigerians can apply for business licenses and visas using their smart phones and computers will help improve services and reduce opportunities for fees to go into pockets rather than government coffers. This new government also has the ability to fight skepticism by making reforms that will allow the Nigerian people to better understand how federal, state, and local resources are being used.Fourth, and finally, is protecting the integrity of Nigeria’s financial system. The cowardly kidnapper, corrupt official, and fraudster all are seeking to launder their money. Taking steps to make your banking system more secure will help reduce the ability of criminals, terrorists, and others to illicitly use the Nigerian financial system.I applaud the leadership of the Tinubu Administration in committing to work with the Financial Action Task Force to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing. Our government stands ready to help work through these steps and challenges in financial institution supervision, implementing controls in high-risk sectors, and pursuing investigations and prosecutions.President Biden and our whole administration are committed to taking steps in these key areas that are at the heart of long-term economic growth. As I said at the start, over the past few decades, progress in Nigeria has not been as fast as many hoped or anticipated.  But, at the same time, the opportunity has never been greater. Your government is pursuing difficult and bold reforms. Your businesses and founders are bursting with ambition and new ideas. And the students I talk to are optimistic and demanding; you all are ready to lead Nigeria to a new chapter. And the United States looks forward to being a partner as you build an economy that works for all Nigerians. "
61,,"September 14, 2023","Thank you, Meena, for the introduction, and thanks to Paul for his leadership. I’m very proud of what CFIUS has accomplished over the past year. And it’s a testament to the incredible team that Paul has assembled.I’m glad to have the opportunity to welcome all of you to Treasury for the 2nd Annual CFIUS Conference. It’s always a pleasure to get to meet those who are so deeply engaged in our work.An open investment climate is crucial to the U.S. economy. Foreign investment creates jobs: In 2021, nearly 8 million workers here were employed by majority-owned U.S. affiliates of foreign multinational enterprises. And foreign investment grows the economy: That year, affiliates contributed $1.2 trillion to U.S. GDP. The impacts of this investment are also geographically widespread: These firms accounted for at least 6% of private sector employment in half of all states in 2021.But national security is a foremost priority, and we deploy a wide range of tools to safeguard it. We’ve made strategic investments in our economic security through the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act. We’ve pursued friend-shoring, deepening ties with our partners for critical inputs. We’ve worked with over thirty countries to impose sanctions and export controls on Russia in the service of a rules-based global order. And, just this past August, President Biden issued an Executive Order restricting certain outbound investments in highly sensitive technologies: semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum information technologies, and artificial intelligence. The Executive Order tasked Treasury with implementing and administering the program. We look forward to the role it will play alongside our other export control and inbound screening tools.CFIUS is one such crucially important tool. Certain investments by foreign persons in the U.S. present national security risks. By rigorously reviewing these foreign investments, we safeguard our national security while keeping the U.S. market an open and welcoming environment for investors. This preserves our status as the top recipient of foreign direct investment, which contributes to our economic strength.  CFIUS requires close collaboration with our partners. As Treasury Secretary, I chair CFIUS, and my team at Treasury works tirelessly to facilitate and coordinate the Committee’s work. But like so much of Treasury’s work, the review process also benefits from departments and agencies from across the government. Each contributes important knowledge and expertise.Our work is also supported by many outside the U.S. government. We particularly welcome feedback from industry and other stakeholders. We encourage businesses to brief the Committee early and to ask any questions they may have on the CFIUS process. We know that certainty matters to transaction parties, and their early engagement helps us too. My colleagues also meet regularly with a broader group of stakeholders drawn from law, business, science, and technology. Today’s conference is another key opportunity for engagement.With CFIUS, close collaboration is complemented by smart policy. Like other actions to protect our national security interests, CFIUS actions should be carefully scoped and targeted. And CFIUS must also reflect a changing world. As new threats and vulnerabilities emerge, our national security priorities shift in response, and CFIUS needs to evolve in parallel.Last June, when Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo spoke at the inaugural CFIUS Conference, he emphasized the 2018 legislation that strengthened and modernized CFIUS. Since the start of this Administration, we’ve closely monitored relevant trends and taken action to reflect them. Production disruptions from the pandemic underscored our security interests in building resilience in our critical supply chains. Almost exactly one year ago, President Biden issued an Executive Order to evolve CFIUS to respond to this priority. The Executive Order also mandated increased attention to certain sectors, such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. And it sharpened focus on factors CFIUS considers in its review, including adding an emphasis on sensitive data.We’ve also renewed our focus on enforcement. While promoting compliance remains the goal, robust enforcement in cases of non-compliance is key. Under the Defense Production Act, the Committee has its own enforcement authority—including subpoena authority—and can impose monetary penalties and seek other remedies for violations. Transparency is crucial to how we go about this work. So, in October 2022, the Treasury Department issued our first-ever CFIUS Enforcement and Penalty Guidelines, providing transaction parties and the public with information about how the Committee assesses violations.We also work closely with our partners and allies to coordinate efforts and enhance our collective security. In our interconnected world, risks do not stop at national boundaries. Our policies are more effective when we share information, better equipping all of us to face these emerging risks. So, we’ve encouraged other countries to adopt and update similar screening mechanisms. Our partners and allies are making substantial progress. In this year alone, we expect six countries will have introduced legislation creating new regimes by year’s end.CFIUS’ work is complex and demanding. I am proud of the work we have done to increase transparency, enhance efficiency, and ramp up compliance and enforcement efforts. But we know there is more to do. As risks evolve, CFIUS and other investment security tools must too.Thank you to those of you attending today and otherwise engaged in work related to CFIUS. You are enabling us to protect our national security and grow our economy through foreign investment. I hope today’s conference provides motivation and clarity to support your work going forward. "
62,,"September 8, 2023","Hello everyone. Thank you for being here. I’d like to share a few introductory thoughts about the priorities we will be focused on throughout this week.First, we are committed to supporting emerging markets and developing countries and to addressing global challenges. This includes our ongoing work on evolving the multilateral development banks.One year since my call to action to the MDBs, we have worked with a growing coalition of partners to make significant progress on reforms related to the World Bank’s mission and vision, incentives, operational model, and financing capacity. We are glad to have Ajay Banga as our partner in this work. And we look forward to more work with the regional development banks and on how to achieve greater collaboration across the MDB system, including to increase access to climate finance.We have already made significant progress in expanding the MDBs’ financial capacity. The recommendations that are currently being implemented or under consideration across the MDBs could unlock an additional $200 billion over the next decade. Those are crucial additional resources for reducing poverty, advancing global health security, and combatting climate change. I saw firsthand the impact this funding can have during my last trip to India just over a month ago, when Ajay Banga and I visited an education data hub supported by the World Bank and met the students whose lives were being improved.There is scope to do even more on financial capacity, including through some of the more medium-term recommendations of the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework review, particularly with respect to callable capital. We are also asking Congress for $2.25 billion to boost the World Bank’s concessional finance for global challenges and for crisis response. And we have requested authorization for a loan of up to $21 billion for the IMF, including for the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT), which desperately needs more resources. We also hope to build support for an equi-proportional increase in quotas during meetings this week.This week also provides an opportunity to discuss debt relief. We continue to support efforts to provide predictable, orderly, and timely debt relief to countries, including under the Common Framework for Debt Treatment, where progress has been too slow.As a second priority area, we remain committed to extensive and strategic multilateral action in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. The price cap and sanctions – both the result of unprecedented global collaboration – are having powerful impacts on Russia’s ability to wage its brutal and unjust war. We also remain committed to support for Ukraine and recently put forward a supplemental funding request. There has been bipartisan support for this funding to date and it’s critical that we continue to provide timely economic assistance. During my visit to Kyiv earlier this year, I saw firsthand the importance of this assistance in enabling Ukraine’s resistance on the frontlines. We are also grateful for the involvement of our partners, including the 50 billion euro package proposed by the European Union and the $15 billion International Monetary Fund program, which has been essential to Ukraine’s efforts to implement reforms and stabilize the economy.And we need to remain focused on addressing the devastating consequences of the war, including its impact on food security. Russia’s withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative is deeply concerning and is particularly being felt by low- and middle-income countries. In response, we hope to move forward on efforts such as supporting the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program and working toward a successful replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.Last but not least, continuing to advance the U.S.-India relationship will be a priority this week. We highly value our bilateral relationship with India. This is my fourth time in India over the last year, making it the country I’ve visited most frequently as Treasury Secretary. We also welcomed Prime Minister Modi to the U.S. in June. The U.S. is home to the largest Indian diaspora outside of Asia and is India’s largest export market. Expanding our bilateral economic ties and our cooperation on global challenges is crucially important to us."
63,,"August 28, 2023","Thank you, Madam Vice President. You’ve been an advocate for workers throughout your time in California and in this Administration, especially through your leadership of the Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment.The President, Vice President, and I understand that jobs provide both a paycheck and a sense of dignity. Since January 2021, we have seen a historically strong jobs recovery from the pandemic. And we are dedicated to creating a fairer, stronger labor market for the long haul.   While we’ve emerged quickly from the pandemic and there have been many positive trends over the past decades, there have also been persistent challenges. Middle-class wages and household incomes have stagnated in recent decades. Both renting and owning a home have become more expensive. So have education and healthcare.With today’s call, we are releasing a Treasury Department report which presents the case that unions can play a role in addressing the challenges faced by the middle class. This report is the Administration’s latest action to strengthen the important role of labor unions in our economy and it is the Treasury Department’s first major effort to lay out the rationale for why we think this is so important.The Treasury Department’s report finds that unions raise the wages of their members by around 10 to 15 percent. We also observe that union workers have greater access to critical fringe benefits, such as retirement benefits, medical benefits, and life insurance.Unions also impact personnel practices, bringing about better workplace grievance systems and improved workplace safety. I began my career as a labor economist, and I’ve found in my own academic work that these non-monetary factors are a key driver of job satisfaction. They are also critically important to workers’ well-being.Unionization also has spillover effects. Competition means workers at nonunionized firms may see increased wages too. Heightened workplace safety norms can pull up whole industries. Benefits also spill over to workers’ families and communities.Importantly, our research also finds that unions fuel equality. Today’s unions benefit all demographic groups. Unions reduce race and gender wage gaps by encouraging explicit anti-discrimination measures and egalitarian wage practices. Working parents, including mothers, benefit from more scheduling predictability, which is more likely in unionized workplaces. And Black men, who have the highest union membership rates of any demographic groups, have also been particularly hit by the trends experienced by the middle class as a whole. They therefore may be particularly poised to benefit from unionization.Taken together, these findings challenge arguments that unions hold back growth. Unions could contribute to reversing the stark increase in inequality we’ve seen in recent decades, promoting economy-wide growth. There are also many cases of unions improving productivity.  President Biden’s Executive Order on Worker Organizing and Empowerment called on each federal agency to take steps to improve opportunities for building worker power. I am proud the Treasury Department is contributing to this effort, including through this report and through a report we released in March of 2022, on uneven bargaining power between employers and employees.Our ongoing implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act is also crucial. Earlier this month, I traveled to Las Vegas to tour the IBEW 357 Training Center, which is preparing workers for the Act’s clean energy jobs.Going forward, I hope research like this report supports continued efforts to build worker power and bring about much-needed gains for the middle class and for the economy as a whole. "

Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
65,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
66,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
67,,"November 21, 2023",
68,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
69,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

70,,"August 14, 2023","Thank you. It’s great to be here in Las Vegas with all of you. I want to especially thank Lamar for your introduction and for your team’s hospitality. And I’m grateful to everyone from the IBEW and building trades unions for your very warm welcome. Many of you may not know that I began my career as a labor economist. I studied the labor market: how workers and companies interact, and when it works well and when it doesn’t. Since then, much of my life has been dedicated to creating an economy that lifts workers and families up, rather than weighing them down. If I’ve learned one lesson from my time in economics, it’s this: American workers are central to our nation’s economic progress. What you are doing here in Vegas – and across the country – demonstrates every day how skilled workers are literally building our new economic future. I couldn’t be more pleased to join you.Just shy of a year ago, I delivered a major economic speech in Michigan that laid out the case for our Administration’s economic plan. At the time, we had just witnessed a historic economic recovery from the depths of the pandemic downturn. An unprecedented pace of job creation had brought the U.S. labor market back in record time. Yet, we were still in the early stages of executing President Biden’s long-term economic agenda. We had just completed the enactment of our trifecta of historic investments: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. During my speech last year, I also explained the principles that guided our economic agenda. I outlined a framework called “modern supply-side economics” – an economic philosophy that animates much of Bidenomics. It focuses on how government can help spur long-term growth through investments on the supply side – such as in our workforce and its productivity. Unlike traditional supply-side economics, this approach cares not only about growth – but also creating a fairer and more sustainable economy. President Biden has advanced a significant core of the modern supply-side agenda through the passage of these three generational laws.Today, I want to discuss what we have accomplished since last summer. I’ll first speak about the state of our economy. Then, I’ll turn to the clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s a historic law that Treasury plays the chief role in implementing. This week, we mark one year since the President signed the IRA into law. I want to speak about the progress we’ve made not only in driving the climate benefits of the law – during a summer when Americans are feeling the harsh realities of climate change. I’d also like to discuss the economic benefits that we are already beginning to see across the country for American workers and families. Powered by the IRA, the President’s agenda has helped drive a massive boom that is touching every corner of the country. Since January 2021, companies have committed over $500 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments. The explosion in U.S. factory construction is a uniquely American story: one that we do not see replicated in other peer countries.Over the past year, our task has been to transition the economy from rapid recovery to stable growth. Our path so far shows that we are on the right track, even as we remain vigilant about potential challenges and uncertainties.Take our labor market: Americans are back to work. Our historically rapid jobs recovery has been a source of strength as we made our way back from the pandemic recession. This recovery was driven in large part by the decisive economic measures that President Biden took to provide assistance to households, businesses, and state and local governments. Since President Biden entered office, over 13 million jobs have been created. Last month, our unemployment rate was at a near record low of 3.5 percent. That’s less than a quarter of the unemployment rate recorded in April 2020.Importantly, we’ve also seen a significant recovery in the share of Americans participating in our workforce. This rebound in labor supply has brought the jobs market into better balance. The overall labor force participation rate is now back in line with pre-pandemic trends. The share of prime-age Americans currently employed – those between the ages of 25 and 54 – has reached its highest level in over 20 years. In fact, the share of prime-age female workers currently employed is the highest it has ever been. Notably, the labor market recovery has been strong for workers across a broad set of communities. The rates of unemployment for Black and Hispanic Americans are at among their lowest on record.These are not abstract statistics. These are real Americans back at work – able to put food on the table, support their families, and save for retirement. As President Biden says, a job is “about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about your place in your community.” The people in this room know that very well. The continued strength of our labor market is particularly impressive given our fight against inflation. Last July, I gave a speech about the remarkable resilience of the American economy and workers in the face of global challenges. There were many who questioned whether that could last. But that’s precisely what we've seen over the past year, even as we remain attuned to the significant risks ahead. Annual headline inflation is now nearly 6 percentage points below its June 2022 peak. Today, overall inflation and the unemployment rate both sit below 4 percent. And our economy continues to expand. Workers are better off than they were last year. Real average hourly earnings have grown over the past year – meaning that wage gains are outpacing inflation. In fact – in 9 out of 14 major sectors – real wages are growing faster than they were in the decade before the pandemic. This has had a sizable impact on reducing inequality: one working paper estimates that wage gains for lower-income workers in recent years have reversed a quarter of the wage inequality that had accumulated over the past 40 years.[1]   The Administration remains committed to taking actions to lower prices for Americans where we can. And we continue to monitor developments, particularly those abroad, that may affect prices and growth. We know that progress rarely moves in a straight line. But I still believe that there is a path to continue reducing inflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. While there are risks, the evidence we’ve seen so far suggests that we are on such a path. Americans are reflecting this optimism: consumer sentiment is at its highest level in almost two years. I expect the important gains that we’ve made over the past two and a half years to serve as a source of resilience in the weeks and months to come, even if we see further cooling in our economy.As we continue to navigate through short-term challenges, the President has been clear that we cannot just make quick fixes. Over the past few decades, we have seen growing pressures on our economy. Many workers and families have felt them personally. They include slowing productivity growth, rising economic inequality, concerns about our energy and national security, and a worsening climate crisis that, if unmitigated, presents an existential threat to us all.Our Administration is taking decisive action against these persistent challenges by investing in America. We have mobilized public and private investments in three strategic sectors as part of our “modern supply-side” agenda. We passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – a generational investment in our physical and digital infrastructure. This law is already delivering tens of thousands of new projects across the country that are increasing our productivity and growth potential. They are also strengthening our competitiveness and supply chain resilience. We also enacted the CHIPS and Science Act – a major investment that is boosting semiconductor manufacturing and incentivizing investments in cutting-edge R&D. A strong semiconductor industrial base at home will help bolster our nation’s resilience to global shocks. Finally, we are implementing the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s our nation’s boldest-ever climate action. And it is beginning to spark an economic renaissance in communities that had been left behind.I’d like to focus specifically on the Inflation Reduction Act as we mark its one-year anniversary. Last year, I identified three goals for this law: tackling climate change, expanding economic opportunity, and strengthening our economic resilience and energy security. Over the past month, we have again seen incontrovertible evidence that climate change is here. We have also seen how it has compounded the effects of unusual weather patterns like El Niño. Extreme heat has scorched communities across the United States. There have been record-breaking temperatures from Phoenix to Miami. Here in Las Vegas, you’ve similarly not been spared by the waves of crippling extreme heat. In fact, scientists estimate that July was the hottest month in the Earth’s modern history. Beyond the heat, a large part of the East Coast and Midwest have been repeatedly shrouded in smoke from wildfires in Canada. Floods have devastated Vermont and other parts of the East Coast, while the Midwest and other regions continue to battle a severe drought. These climate events have real economic impacts on Americans – even if they are spared from the physical impacts. As an example, home insurers are hiking rates or pulling back entirely from highly vulnerable areas in states like California and Florida. These developments are having a significant economic impact on homeownership – which has long been the cornerstone of the American Dream and a primary driver of household wealth.President Biden has identified this decade as the “decisive decade” to combat climate change. The United States has committed to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by at least half from 2005 levels by 2030. And we have committed to a net-zero economy by 2050. Tackling climate change requires global action. But the United States must do our part, and a clear signal from the world’s largest economy can mobilize action by other nations. While more is needed, scientific studies conclude that the IRA – and other Administration actions – are moving us well toward achieving our commitments under the Paris Agreement. Our climate strategy is based on a simple premise: targeted public investments can help mobilize private capital toward compelling public policy objectives. This is an old strategy that we’ve successfully utilized in the past – like in the development of new technologies like the Internet. The IRA invests in both demand- and supply-side incentives to build the clean energy economy. On the supply side, the IRA expands and extends the existing foundation of tax incentives. These incentives provide long-term certainty for investors in pursuing clean energy projects. With the IRA, investors have greater confidence to scale-up deployment of established technologies like solar energy. The IRA also helps develop nascent technologies like clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. These are essential to reducing emissions from harder-to-abate sectors. Expansions on the supply side are also matched by IRA tax credits and rebates to drive up demand for consumer goods like electric vehicles, heat pumps, and energy-efficient appliances. Together, these incentives spur greater innovation and competition in the clean energy industry. And they drive down the cost curves of these technologies. Lower costs mean greater adoption. This will not only help the United States mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions. It will help the rest of the world as well. Thanks to the IRA, one study estimates that for every ton of carbon dioxide reduced within our country, 2-3 tons of reductions will be achieved outside the United States.[2] The climate transition is one of the biggest economic transitions of our lifetimes. Today, over $1 trillion in new capital each year is being invested in clean energy around the globe. But for far too long, economic opportunity in the United States has been concentrated on the coasts. That must change. We must not only create clean energy jobs in the aggregate – but the employment and other benefits of this transition must accrue broadly across all communities. A core goal of the IRA is to revitalize communities that have suffered industrial decline or been left behind. We are putting American workers and American jobs at the center of our clean energy transition, making sure Americans in every part of our country benefit from the rising global demand for low-carbon products.  The early results are in. Through my travels, I’ve seen how the clean energy industry is expanding across the country. I’ve visited solar companies in North Carolina and Louisiana. I’ve toured an EV battery plant in Tennessee. And I see the difference that the IRA is making in Nevada as well. In the Midwest and the South, there are now so many shovels in the ground for new EV battery factories that many are dubbing these regions the new “Battery Belt.” Treasury’s analysis indicates that investments in clean energy, EVs, and batteries since the President took office have been concentrated in counties that need them the most – that is, those that had lagged the country in earnings, college graduation rates, and child poverty rates.This progress has not occurred by happenstance. The Inflation Reduction Act provides place-based incentives that bolster the business case to invest in certain communities. There is a bonus incentive for companies to invest in solar and wind projects in low-income communities, complementing Treasury’s other work to bolster capital access in these places. It’s also important that cities and towns that have served as the backbone of our nation’s traditional energy production are not left behind. The IRA provides a bonus for companies that invest in areas with closed coal mines or coal-fired power plants, and other communities that have relied on jobs in fossil fuel industries. This is a major pillar in our Administration’s broader effort to renew the economic potential of our nation’s energy communities. Importantly, the workers that are driving the clean energy transition – like those in this room – must benefit from it. So, the law requires companies to adhere to strong wage standards and apprenticeship requirements to claim the full value of many incentives. Earlier this summer, Treasury also released proposed guidance that would make it easier for these tax credits to reach a broad range of institutions. We are implementing innovative tools that will enable states, cities, towns, and tax-exempt organizations – like schools and hospitals – to directly access these credits. These measures serve as a force multiplier for the IRA. And they allow clean energy projects to be built more quickly, affordably, and by more entities. As a result of this provision, we expect the massive benefits of the IRA to be felt more rapidly and more broadly.  Investing in underserved communities is not just an important moral imperative. It’s also smart economics. One study indicates that boosting employment in “distressed” regions results in at least 60 percent greater economic benefits than those in “booming” ones.[3] Put simply, it gives us a bigger bang for our buck. All of us benefit when we bring people back into the workforce and provide them and others with access to good-paying, high-quality jobs in the industries of the future.The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides significant investment to adapt to climate change. That includes protecting our infrastructure against droughts, floods, and extreme heat. But beyond climate adaptation, we must also mitigate our vulnerabilities to shocks emanating from our reliance on fossil fuels. Over the past couple of years, we have seen how huge swings in the price of oil can put tremendous pressure on the pocketbooks of American families. We have also witnessed Russia weaponize its energy exports against our European allies and partners. Energy is the lifeblood of our economy. A clean energy transition will enable us to depend more on the wind and the sun – and less on fossil fuels and the whims of those who control those resources. It will make a difference to ordinary Americans, who will have greater stability and predictability in their energy costs. This means greater certainty in their budgets – and less time looking at the price boards outside of gas stations.But we must do more. As we move away from fossil fuels, we remain concerned about the risks of over-concentration in clean energy supply chains. Today, the production of critical clean energy inputs – from batteries to solar panels to critical minerals – is concentrated in a handful of countries. It’s important that we build resilient and diversified critical global supply chains that can reduce chokepoints, mitigate disruptions, and protect our economic security. That starts by investing here at home. The IRA is helping re-shore some of the production that is critical to our clean energy economy. Looking beyond our shores, we are also working hard to accelerate the clean energy transition in other countries. Accelerating these transitions can mean greater demand for U.S. clean energy technologies produced by American workers. It can also bolster global clean energy supply chains.As we look forward to the fall and beyond: it’s remarkable to consider how far we’ve come. Our Administration is laser-focused on continuing to provide clarity on the law so that its benefits can continue to be felt as soon as possible by American workers and families. We are also providing important guardrails so taxpayer resources are effectively spent. The IRS plays a major role in administering the IRA’s clean energy incentives. We believe that the IRS modernization initiative is essential to the law’s successful implementation. We will continue our efforts to build a tax administration system that is fit for the 21st century.Twenty-five years ago, I gave my first major speech warning about the economic dangers of climate change. Since that time, we have seen climate impacts intensify. But while the world had long recognized the need for decisive action, the federal government had been missing in action. No longer. Over the past year, we have seen the early results of bold federal action through the IRA and the Administration’s broader climate agenda. Importantly, we have seen how climate action advances our nation’s economic priorities. The IRA is driving economic growth, expanding economic opportunity, and bolstering our resilience. This is good for the American workers in this room – and so many others across the United States."
71,,"August 10, 2023","“The United States is steadfast in its commitment to support the Ukrainian people and Government as they continue to defend themselves against Russia’s barbaric war. We are grateful for the strong bipartisan congressional support that is vital to Ukraine’s fight and survival as a sovereign democratic state, as well as the support from our allies and partners who have delivered tens of billions of dollars in economic and security assistance. Sustaining our direct budget support helps reinforce Ukraine’s brave resistance and mitigate the consequences of Russia’s brutal war by providing the Government of Ukraine with the resources it needs to deliver essential services, such as healthcare, education, and funding for emergency first responders including after Russian air strikes. The United States will continue to lead the worldwide coalition we have built in supporting Ukraine, particularly as U.S. assistance catalyzes further financial support from other countries and the international financial institutions (IFIs). We are grateful for the increased burden-sharing from our partners that we have seen following our commitments. That includes under Ukraine’s International Monetary Fund (IMF) program, which has proven critical to Ukraine’s efforts to implement reforms and stabilize the economy.Beyond Ukraine, America must maintain its global economic leadership role through the international financial institutions and use them to address the world’s most pressing needs. Russia’s war continues to have devastating impacts on other countries, stymying growth, exacerbating food insecurity, and increasing poverty. To address these widespread impacts, we are requesting vital support for developing countries through the IFIs. That includes a contribution for a new portfolio guarantee platform at the World Bank to support reform efforts under the MDB evolution initiative launched by the United States, which would unlock roughly $25 billion in new lending; grants to bring down costs of the new lending; and $1 billion for the International Development Association’s Crisis Response Window.  These contributions will support low-income countries in their immediate response to the food crises and other spillovers from Russia’s war and incentivize investments in developing countries that address global challenges.  Finally, we are seeking authorization to make loans to two IMF trust funds, which will enable the IMF to continue supporting vulnerable countries in the face of Russia’s destructive and destabilizing actions. We are working to leverage this U.S. action at the IFIs to mobilize $200 billion of new financing for developing countries, backed by our partners and allies. Collectively, these efforts will demonstrate unwavering U.S. leadership on the global stage and our commitment to helping the most vulnerable countries and people.”"
72,,"August 2, 2023","Over the past few years, the American economy has seen a historic recovery from the depths of the pandemic downturn. Over 13 million new jobs have been created since January 2021. Our unemployment rate stands at 3.6 percent – near historic lows. Overall annual inflation has declined every month for the past year. And our economy continues to grow. In the longer term, the United States remains the world’s largest, most dynamic, and most innovative economy – with the strongest financial system in the world.Fitch’s decision is puzzling in light of the economic strength we see in the United States. I strongly disagree with Fitch’s decision, and I believe it is entirely unwarranted. Its flawed assessment is based on outdated data and fails to reflect improvements across a range of indicators, including those related to governance, that we’ve seen over the past two and a half years. Despite the gridlock, we have seen both parties come together to pass legislation to resolve the debt limit, as well as to make historic investments in our infrastructure and American competitiveness. Fiscal responsibility is a priority for President Biden and me. Earlier this year, the President signed debt limit legislation that included over $1 trillion in deficit reduction. His budget would also improve the fiscal outlook by reducing the deficit by $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Today, we are here to speak about an IRS modernization project – launched this time last year – that will reduce our deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade by ensuring that the IRS has the resources it needs to enforce against wealthy taxpayers and large corporations that have not paid the taxes they owe.At the end of the day, Fitch’s decision does not change what all of us already know: that Treasury securities remain the world’s preeminent safe and liquid asset, and that the American economy is fundamentally strong.Let me first thank Commissioner Werfel for his leadership of the IRS. Commissioner: just five months into your current tenure, you’ve hit the ground running and made your mark on this institution. I am grateful for the deep management experience and dedication to good government that you bring to this difficult job. It’s a pleasure to be back with the employees of the IRS. Almost a year ago, I visited the IRS facility in New Carrollton, Maryland. I underscored that, as our nation’s revenue collection agency, the IRS is a foundation of our government and society. The agency collects 96 percent of the revenue that funds the federal government. By extension, it plays an indispensable role in priorities from our national defense to retirement security to the construction and maintenance of our infrastructure. The IRS also serves as one of the few parts of the government that touches nearly every American household. I also stressed then – as I always have – that I would do everything I could to support you as you step up to serve the American people at this critical juncture.It is remarkable what the employees of the IRS have been able to do. Over the three years of the COVID-19 emergency, our nation lived through multiple variants, the closures of schools and businesses, and disruption of day-to-day activities. Throughout it all, you worked around the clock to collect our nation’s revenues and deliver critical relief to Americans in need. And last year, with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, you were called once again to meet the moment. This time, the task was to transform the IRS and create a fairer and more modernized tax administration system that the American people expect and deserve. I know it has not been easy. But I know that this is a transformation that many of you have advocated for so long.We have so much progress to report – thanks to your hard work and dedication. Last year, I laid out several goals for the 2023 Filing Season. Let me speak about how we did on each of them.First, we set a bold goal to drastically transform the level of customer service that taxpayers can expect through the phone. During the 2022 filing season, the IRS averaged a 10-15 percent level of service – meaning that it answered less than 2 of every 10 calls. Our goal for this year’s filing season was to achieve an 85 percent level of service. Because of your hard work, I’m pleased to announce that we exceeded that goal. We reached an 87 percent level of service with live assistance this filing season. That’s more than a five-fold increase. This drastic improvement is thanks to over 5,000 new hires made possible by the Inflation Reduction Act. We answered 3 million more phone calls than in 2022. And we cut wait times from 28 minutes down to 3 minutes. That’s astounding progress that we should all be proud of.Second, we advanced our commitment to expand in-person assistance and meet taxpayers in the communities where they live. In total, we served 140,000 more taxpayers in person through the end of this filing season than last year’s. We’ve opened or reopened 35 Taxpayer Assistance Centers since the passage of the law. That includes one in Vienna. And it includes ones in Fredericksburg, just an hour south of here, and Charlottesville, two hours southwest of here. There are new or newly reopened assistance centers in dozens of cities and towns from Colorado to Pennsylvania to Mississippi. The IRS has also begun setting up temporary pop-up assistance centers in hard-to-reach areas that may be far from permanent IRS centers. In June, the IRS hosted its first such pop-up event in Paris, Texas. There are plans to do many more across the country.Third, I announced that we would automate the scanning of millions of paper returns in 2023 – and that millions of taxpayers would be able to receive and respond to notices online. Because of your work, we are doing just that. We’ve made it easier and quicker for Americans to interact with the agency. In the first quarter of this year, the IRS scanned 80 times more paper returns than in the entire year of 2022. Taxpayers were also able to respond online to 10 of the most common tax notices – including those that alert taxpayers to the fact that they may be eligible for certain tax credits that they have not claimed. By the middle of this month, we plan to expand this functionality to an additional 53 notices that are currently received through the mail.  As the National Taxpayer Advocate has said, the difference between this filing season and last year’s has been like “night and day.” The accomplishments I just outlined are just a fraction of what you’ve done. You’ve undertaken heroic efforts to address the pandemic backlog of unprocessed returns. I’m extraordinarily proud that the IRS has fully cleared the backlog of 2022 individual returns that have no errors. Today, I’m pleased to announce another major milestone for the IRS. It’s one that we are calling “Paperless Processing.” And it marks a significant step in our efforts to digitalize IRS operations. Today, we are announcing that – by the next filing season – taxpayers will be able to digitally submit all correspondence, non-tax forms, and notice responses to the IRS. Of course, taxpayers will always have the choice to submit documents by paper. For those taxpayers, by Filing Season 2025, the IRS is committing to digitally process 100 percent of tax and information returns that are submitted by paper – as well as half of all paper correspondence, non-tax forms, and notice responses. It will also digitalize historical documents that are currently in storage at the IRS. In a few moments, Commissioner Werfel will provide more details about this announcement. But let me briefly explain why this is a massive transformation. Despite previous modernization efforts, the IRS has remained, in large part, a paper-based agency. The agency receives about 200 million paper documents a year – many of which still undergo manual processing. It also has decades of historical documents that together cost around $40 million a year to store. But thanks to the IRA, we are in the process of transforming the IRS into a digital-first agency. This “Paperless Processing” initiative is the key that unlocks other customer service improvements. It will enable taxpayers to see their documents, securely access their data, and save time and money. And it will allow other parts of the IRS to rely on these digital copies to provide faster refunds, reduce errors in tax processing, and deliver a more seamless and responsive customer service experience. And much more. I urge Congress to provide stable and sufficient annual appropriations for the IRS in order to sustain and build on this progress. In addition to these customer service improvements, we are also making progress on our effort to build a fairer tax system. Without the IRA, our country had faced a tax gap – the gap between the taxes owed and those paid – of an astounding $7 trillion over the next decade. With the IRA, we are shrinking this tax gap through investments that will help us audit wealthy and large corporate taxpayers that have not paid the taxes they owe. As I’ve said, I have directed that IRA resources not be used to increase the audit rate for small businesses and households making under $400,000 a year, relative to historical levels. The focus of our enforcement efforts is on peeling back the structures of large corporations, complex partnerships, and other high-income and high-wealth taxpayers to make sure that they are paying their full bill. We know that this requires investment: it takes up to 50 times as long to review the tax returns of wealthy individuals than to complete simple audits. Corporate audits similarly average hundreds of hours over two to four years. That’s why the IRS is focused on hiring top talent, as well as using data and analytics to pursue smarter enforcement and go after cases most likely to reveal significant tax evasion.I believe that these improvements are a matter of smart economics. After all, we expect our fair enforcement effort to more than pay for itself – reducing our deficits by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. But I also believe it is a matter of fundamental fairness. It’s essential that when regular taxpayers accurately file their taxes, they know that other Americans are also doing the same. Of course, we are just as committed to helping honest taxpayers get it right in the first place. The IRS is investing in resources that help taxpayers identify and avoid errors before they file their returns – and claim the credits and deductions that they are eligible for. The IRS has also made common-sense changes – like ending most unannounced visits to taxpayers. That reform will enhance safety for taxpayers and IRS employees and bolster confidence in its work.The dividends on these investments will take time to see. But the IRS has already taken aggressive action over the past few months to crack down on tax evasion. In recent months, the agency has closed about 175 delinquent tax cases for millionaires. That has generated about $38 million in recoveries. The IRS has also continued to intensify its effort to enforce against wealthy individuals who fail to file tax returns at all. To conclude: in less than a year since the passage of the IRA, we have seen the early results of our investment in the IRS. I believe those results speak for themselves. Today’s announcement – and the other milestones that we’ve already reached – are a testament to what dedicated federal employees can do when they are provided the tools and resources to succeed. I am grateful to everyone at the IRS for their extraordinary dedication to public service – and their hard work in building an IRS that works for the American people."
73,,"August 1, 2023","“I strongly disagree with Fitch Ratings’ decision. The change by Fitch Ratings announced today is arbitrary and based on outdated data. Fitch’s quantitative ratings model declined markedly between 2018 and 2020 – and yet Fitch is announcing its change now, despite the progress that we see in many of the indicators that Fitch relies on for its decision. Many of these measures, including those related to governance, have shown improvement over the course of this Administration, with the passage of bipartisan legislation to address the debt limit, invest in infrastructure, and make other investments in America’s competitiveness.Fitch’s decision does not change what Americans, investors, and people all around the world already know: that Treasury securities remain the world’s preeminent safe and liquid asset, and that the American economy is fundamentally strong.Over the past few years, the United States has undergone a historically fast economic recovery from a deep recession. Today, the unemployment rate is near historic lows, inflation has come down significantly since last summer, and last week’s GDP report shows that the U.S. economy continues to grow. The American economy remains the world’s largest and most dynamic economy, with the deepest and most liquid financial markets in the world. To build on this, President Biden and I have been focused on making critical investments in our country’s core economic strength and productive capacity. President Biden and I are committed to fiscal sustainability. The most recent debt limit legislation included over $1 trillion in deficit reduction and improved our fiscal trajectory. Looking forward, President Biden has put forward a budget that would reduce the deficit by $2.6 trillion over the next decade through a balanced approach that would support investments for the long-term.” "
74,,"July 25, 2023","It is a great pleasure to welcome Minister of Finance Al-Ississ, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Toukan, Central Bank Governor Sharkas and Ambassador Kawar to Treasury.Jordan, under the leadership of His Majesty King Abdullah, and his father before, has been a close friend and ally of the United States for many years.  When President Biden met the King, he reaffirmed the United States’ unwavering support to Jordan as a key ally and a force for peace in the region.Treasury also has a close partnership with Jordan, and I look forward to building on this today and discussing developments with the Jordanian economic team.Like other countries, Jordan has been affected by the recent turbulence in the world, including global shocks like climate change and the food security crises caused by Russia’s war in Ukraine.  The Jordanian government has taken strong steps to address Jordan’s challenges, and to place it on the road to faster, more sustainable, and inclusive growth.  In this context, I want particularly to commend Jordan for the recent sixth review of its IMF program, which went smoothly and swiftly, on the basis of the strong reform measures Jordan has implemented."
75,,"July 21, 2023","HANOI – U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and State Bank of Vietnam Governor Nguyen Thi Hong today released a joint statement following their meeting during Secretary Yellen’s visit to Hanoi:""The U.S. Department of the Treasury (U.S. Treasury) and the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) recognize that we have a significant opportunity to strengthen cooperation toward the shared objective of strong, inclusive, and sustainable growth through well-designed macroeconomic policies and efforts to maintain financial stability.  The U.S. Treasury also appreciates the SBV’s ongoing efforts to further modernize and enhance the transparency of its monetary policy and exchange rate management framework, to promote macroeconomic stability, and to ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system.The U.S. Treasury and the SBV have therefore agreed to deepen their engagement in key areas.  The U.S. Treasury and the SBV intend to hold a regular dialogue at a senior staff level on macroeconomic and financial policies, allowing the United States and Vietnam to improve understanding of each other’s macroeconomic and financial conditions and policies; share knowledge on promoting the development of stable and efficient financial markets; and support our mutual objectives of robust, resilient, secure, and inclusive economic growth and financial stability.  Towards this end, the U.S. Treasury and the SBV have separately agreed to explore a potential technical assistance partnership.The United States and Vietnam are trusted partners with a friendship grounded in mutual respect and the shared goal of promoting strong, resilient, secure, and inclusive growth.  We look forward to strengthening this partnership further in coming years.”   "
76,,"July 21, 2023","I know our discussion today will be about broader topics – like macroeconomic issues and the relationship between the U.S. and Vietnam – but I’d like to use my opening remarks to address the importance of empowering women in the economy.Events like this, where I see so many women leaders coming together, give me cause for optimism. Women business leaders and economists play an invaluable role in Vietnam’s booming economy.Earlier this year, the Asian Development Bank reported that women own only 17% of all companies in Vietnam and lead just 27% of them. Of course, Vietnam isn’t alone: gender disparities exist in the United States and all over the world.I would like to stress that having women at the center of decision-making is not just a moral imperative. It’s also an economic one. Economies are stronger when they are built on robust and dynamic labor markets that allow women enter and thrive in good jobs.Your country is experiencing an impressive economic transformation, which is creating new and exciting economic opportunities that can open new avenues for leadership by those from underrepresented groups in business and economics.Of course, advancing economic opportunity is just one part of a broader effort to promote a more equal and prosperous society, and there is more work that we must all do to advance social and public health goals as well. For example, access to affordable and quality childcare is key to facilitating women’s greater participation in the labor market.I know that the Vietnamese government has identified women’s economic empowerment as a key priority, and we stand ready to help support that effort – and to also bolster our overall economic partnership with Vietnam across a variety of sectors and initiatives."
77,,"July 21, 2023","The United States considers Vietnam a key partner in the Indo-Pacific. I place considerable priority on further strengthening our bilateral economic relationship.I’ve been impressed by the economic dynamism in your country and am pleased that I was able to meet yesterday with leaders from the U.S. business community to learn first-hand about the opportunities they see in Vietnam and the ways their activity here can benefit workers and firms in the U.S. as well.Beyond the direct benefits of our economic relationship, I also believe that the deep economic ties between the U.S. and Vietnam help create greater economic resilience through what I call 'friendshoring’.‘Friendshoring’ is about expanding our trade ties and diversifying our supply chains among many trusted partners like Vietnam to mitigate against global shocks, geopolitical risks, and overconcentration in critical industries.We see that in action right now in Vietnam, and we want to continue to encourage that moving forward through initiatives like the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, of which we are both a part.Along with the International Partners Group colleagues, the UK and EU, I was very encouraged by the announcement of the Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, in December."
78,,"July 21, 2023","Thank you for that kind introduction. I’m thrilled to be in Hanoi for my first visit to Vietnam as Treasury Secretary. And I’m thankful to the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council and the companies here for your warm welcome. In 1995, the United States and Vietnam normalized our diplomatic relations. In the 28 years since, we’ve seen a remarkable transformation sweep this country – from here in Hanoi down to Ho Chi Minh City. This economic boom has been driven by the hard work and talent of the Vietnamese people. And it has been catalyzed by the engine of market reforms and global trade and investment. Vietnam is now a key player on the global economic stage and serves in a critical role in many vital global supply chains. During this trip, I have seen firsthand the dynamism and energy that has propelled your economic development. This undeniable strength will help you achieve your goal of becoming a high-income country by 2045. The United States has been your steadfast partner. At the turn of the century, we were proud to sign a robust bilateral trade agreement to expand our economic relationship. In 2007, Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization. Since then, our relationship has only broadened and deepened. Our trade now encompasses everything from machinery to textiles to electronic components. Many of America’s largest companies – like Apple and Google – have a significant and growing presence in Vietnam. For the past two decades, trade between our two countries grew at nearly 25 percent a year. That’s an astounding rate. Not only has U.S. imports of Vietnamese goods skyrocketed, but today, the U.S. exports nearly 20 times more to Vietnam than in 2002.There is no sign that this momentum is slowing. Our goods trade reached a record high last year. I believe this strong economic relationship is possible because it is founded on mutual trust: it stems from our work to address the legacies of the war and is underpinned by the close and growing links between our peoples.Today, I’d like to speak about how our economic partnership has grown even more important over the past few years. Since 2020, our countries – and the entire world – have faced a series of historic economic, public health, and geopolitical shocks. In response, President Biden and I are advancing an agenda to strengthen our economic resilience. A driving principle of this agenda is to deepen U.S. engagement and cooperation with a broad network of reliable economic partners in areas like trade and climate. These efforts are not only focused on advanced economies – but also on developing countries and emerging markets like Vietnam. In 2020, the world was struck by a once-in-a-century global pandemic. It claimed millions of lives and brought the world economy to a standstill. Two years later, Russia launched a barbaric full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This war has led to the loss of many innocent Ukrainian lives and destroyed cities and civilian infrastructure. And it has generated seismic volatility in the prices of commodities like food and oil. The impacts of these shocks have reverberated around the world – from here in Southeast Asia to Africa to North America.While the causes of these disruptions are global, their impacts are personal. The COVID pandemic caused the first rollback in extreme poverty gains in decades. It also disrupted global supply chains, preventing families and businesses from getting the essential goods that they relied on. These shocks also contributed to global inflation – putting tremendous pressure on household budgets that were already tight to begin with. President Biden and I believe that this experience compels us to advance a comprehensive economic resilience agenda. Our efforts start at home – but they do not stop there. Strengthening our economic resilience requires increasing cooperation and engagement with our international partners against the risks that we all face. In an interconnected world, disruptions in one region can have cascading economic impacts on the opposite side of the globe. Building true resilience in the United States requires bolstering resilience among our allies and partners. Our Administration’s focus has been to build resilience in sectors that are critical to our national and economic security. Let me speak specifically on our trade and climate efforts. On trade, our Administration is pursuing an approach called “friendshoring” – aimed at building secure and reliable supply chains. Our goal is to reduce the vulnerability of our economy to supply shocks in the production of critical goods, especially due to over-concentration, geopolitical and security risks, and violations of human rights. To do so, we are investing at home to build redundancies in our supply chains. Driven by President Biden’s historic laws, we have already seen a remarkable boom in manufacturing facilities in America. A Treasury analysis shows that real manufacturing construction in the U.S. has doubled since the end of 2021. But we do not seek to build everything in America. Rather, we believe that long-term economic resilience requires diversified global supply chains. This means deepening our economic integration with the large number of countries we can count on – including Vietnam. A priority is to build resilience in our semiconductor supply chain. Semiconductors are essential building blocks of the modern economy. They are critical to the production of everyday consumer products like cars and refrigerators – and the development of cutting-edge technologies like advanced robotics. And yet, virtually all manufacturing of the most sophisticated chips is concentrated in East Asia. Recent experience demonstrates the economic pain that disruption of this key supply chain can cause. One study estimates that the chip shortage during the pandemic likely contributed to worldwide revenue losses of over $500 billion from 2020 to 2022. The impact was particularly acute for the automotive industry – an industry with a large presence in Vietnam. In 2021 alone, this single industry was estimated to have lost $210 billion in global revenue. The United States is taking a comprehensive approach to diversify and strengthen our semiconductor ecosystem. We are first investing in our own domestic capacities through the CHIPS and Science Act. This law provides incentives for manufacturers to build fabrication plants in the United States. But no country can or should do this alone. We are working with our partner countries to ramp up their investments as well. For example, we have dedicated a new $500 million fund for international semiconductor and telecom projects under the CHIPS Act. This fund can help countries in the Indo-Pacific develop their own diverse and resilient semiconductor supply chains. Greater diversification benefits everyone. When activity moves from concentrated or risky parts of the global supply chain, it puts the U.S. and world economy in a more secure position. As we see in Vietnam, it can also promote economic and workforce development. Over the past decade, Vietnam has emerged as a critical node in the global semiconductor supply chain. And investments are only accelerating. Less than an hour’s drive from here in Bac Ninh province, Amkor – an Arizona-based company – will soon fully open a state-of-the-art mega factory for semiconductor assembly and testing. Down in the southern province of Dong Nai, another American company, Onsemi, produces chips that are used in cars halfway around the world. Nearby – in Saigon Hi-Tech Park – sits the largest Intel assembly and testing facility in the world. Many of the companies investing in Vietnam are also building up their capacity and employment in the United States as well. More broadly, Vietnam and the United States have worked together to bolster resilient supply chains with other countries. We are two of over a dozen countries that are part of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Two months ago, the Framework’s member countries announced a proposed agreement to strengthen supply chain resilience. Under the agreement, partners would collaborate to build a collective understanding of supply chain vulnerabilities, improve crisis response, and identify opportunities for technical assistance and capacity building. Notably, it also emphasizes the importance of expanding the benefits of these efforts to workers and small businesses, including by promoting worker training and worker rights.As we undertake these supply chain efforts, let me be very clear: friendshoring is not for an exclusive club of countries. It is open and inclusive of advanced economies, emerging markets, and developing countries alike. The United States is working to strengthen – not weaken – our ties with the emerging and developing world, as demonstrated by our partnership with Vietnam. That’s why we have launched new initiatives to invest in the development of our partner countries. This includes taking part in the G7’s pledge to mobilize $600 billion in infrastructure investment over the next few years through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. Reducing the risk of trade shocks is not the only important challenge that we face. The worsening climate crisis poses severe risks not only to the reliability of critical supplies. It also presents risks to the broader macroeconomy and the health and wellbeing of our communities. As the world continues to warm, climate change threatens to reduce the productive capacity of communities across the world. Beyond these chronic impacts, climate change can also increase the frequency and intensity of acute supply shocks – like heat waves that exacerbate energy shortages and floods and hurricanes that devastate entire regions. We also know that the climate crisis disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable and poorest among us.There is a robust, scientifically backed economic case for why we must take immediate action to mitigate and adapt to climate change – and why we must help others do so as well. In the United States, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law last year. The IRA is the boldest action we have taken to address climate change and meet our commitments under the Paris Agreement. By accelerating our transition to a clean energy economy, the law is also a critical step toward strengthening U.S. energy security. And it will have impacts across the world by pushing down the cost curves of new clean technologies and speeding up their adoption. This domestic investment – alongside President Biden’s pledge to double international climate assistance – makes this Administration a leader in combatting the climate crisis.Just as we build resilience for ourselves, we are committed to helping other countries build their own resilience as well. The United States is proud to support Vietnam’s transition toward a net-zero economy by 2050. Last year, Vietnam and the International Partners Group, of which the United States is a member, launched a Just Energy Transition Partnership to mobilize over $15 billion in public and private financing to accelerate the clean energy transition here in Vietnam. We are encouraged by Vietnam’s ambitious new targets under the JETP. Now, it is vital that we intensify our cooperation to build momentum for these efforts in Vietnam, evaluate project opportunities with the multilateral development banks, and deliver a Resource Mobilization Plan that provides a roadmap for implementation. Beyond mitigating the climate crisis, this partnership with Vietnam can help catalyze the development of new cutting-edge, clean energy industries. It can broaden economic opportunity for Vietnamese workers.More broadly, the United States is continuing to work to meet President Biden’s commitment of providing more than $11 billion in annual international public climate finance by 2024. We are also focused on achieving the collective goal by developed countries to mobilize $100 billion in annual climate finance. We are pressing the international financial institutions to make reforms that are unlocking new funding for climate. For example, the U.S. is working with a broad coalition of countries to evolve the multilateral development bank system to more readily combat 21st-century global challenges like climate change. As a result of our initiative, the World Bank is more actively supporting countries in their fight against climate change and evolving the way it operates to better combat poverty and support development.To close: I’m thrilled to be in Vietnam with you today. Your country has been one of the brightest development stories in the past decade. The United States is proud to continue to support and partner with you to build economic prosperity for our countries. A strong economic partnership is in both of our interests. Over the past few years, our lives and livelihoods have been disrupted by historic economic shocks. These shocks have impacted us all; they have not respected borders. This hard experience has taught us that economic resilience must be a key part of our economic strategy – and that true long-term resilience can only come through deepening international engagement with a broad range of countries. That includes Vietnam. Despite our difficult and complicated history, I am optimistic about the economic future we are building together. "

This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly.

82,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
83,,"November 21, 2023",
84,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
85,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

86,,"July 20, 2023","This facility – and the electric vehicles and batteries you produce – are tremendously impressive. It speaks to something that has struck me each time I’ve had the chance to visit Vietnam: The immense economic dynamism and entrepreneurial spirit of the Vietnamese people.The origins of Selex also highlight the close ties between people in our two countries: Two of its founders pursued graduate education at the University of Michigan.In fact, over 30,000 Vietnamese students are studying in the United States, constituting the fifth-largest group of foreign students in the United States.In turn, the Vietnamese community has enriched the United States, with over two million Americans of Vietnamese descent playing important roles across our society.Climate change poses an existential threat to humanity, and we are increasingly seeing its impact on our countries and across the globe. But combatting it is also a key economic opportunity, and one of the primary ways we can build greater resilience into our economies against shocks that can cause tremendous disruption.In the United States, President Biden and I have placed a clean energy transition at the center of our economic plan – including through the Inflation Reduction Act.Since the President took office, we’ve seen $500 billion in manufacturing and clean energy investments in America. Battery plants and EV factories like this are sprouting across the United States. Those factories, in turn, are supporting good-paying jobs in many communities.America is proud to support the Just Energy Transition Partnership launched last year for Vietnam. Among our partners, we have committed to mobilizing over $15 billion to spur the adoption of renewable sources of energy.We also are working to evolve the Multilateral Development Banks, or MDBs, to better address global challenges like climate change in a way that complements their core poverty reduction goals.Since my call-to-action last October, we have made significant progress on this effort. We estimate that the MDBs as a system could unlock $200 billion in additional lending capacity over the next decade, just from measures already being implemented or under consideration.Just as importantly, we are encouraging the MDBs to more actively partner with the private sector, as public capital alone will not be sufficient to meet the world’s needs for energy transition.Selex itself received an equity investment from the Asian Development Bank. And the factory around us demonstrates the impact that these investments can have on both the economy and the environment.It is our hope and desire to see this clean energy ecosystem grow and thrive, with resilient supply chains between the United States and reliable trading partners like Vietnam – a concept that I’ve described as ‘friendshoring’.Here in Southeast Asia, we’re advancing these shared priorities through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, of which both the United States and Vietnam are members. One of its four pillars focuses on how we can work collaboratively to grow the green economy."
87,,"July 20, 2023","Bilateral trade has grown tremendously over the past three decades, reaching a high of $138 billion in goods trade last year, a remarkable achievement in just 28 years.We are encouraged by the growing investments that companies are making in Vietnam, from those in the semiconductor ecosystem to the clean energy supply chain, which are creating new opportunities for Vietnamese workers and businesses.There are more than two million Vietnamese-Americans and over 30,000 Vietnamese students are studying in the United States—the fifth-largest group of foreign students in the United States.Our two peoples share many things in common. And personally, as an economist, I know I share many similar experiences as those of you who have joined me for lunch today. For example, I know what it’s like when you’re the only woman in the room or at the decision-making table.I am eager to hear about your backgrounds and research, including about your careers and your thoughts on how we can further bolster the partnership between our two countries."
88,,"July 20, 2023","Thank you, Governor Hong, for hosting me today. I’m glad we are finally able to meet in person here in Hanoi following our first videoconference two years ago.More broadly, in the 28 years since we normalized relations, the bilateral relationship between the United States and Vietnam has grown deeper and broader.Vietnam is a close economic partner, with our two-way trade reaching record highs last year and the United States serving as Vietnam’s largest export market.I look forward to discussing ways the United States Treasury and the State Bank of Vietnam can cooperate more closely on a broader set of economic and financial issues going forward."
89,,"July 16, 2023","I’d like to thank the state and national organizers for the opportunity to tour this Control and Command Center stood up by the Education Department of the State of Gujarat today.Education is a powerful driver of development and one of the most effective investments for unlocking economic growth, reducing poverty, and promoting social inclusion.Good education can help individuals acquire the skills needed for successful employment and steady income. It can promote health gains. Positive national educational outcomes can drive a nation’s economic growth, spur innovation, and bolster inclusion and social cohesion.In sum, education is a bedrock for prosperity and stability. It is a core part of breaking the cycle of inter-generational poverty and creating sustainable development.This center is supported by the World Bank, and like other investments the World Bank and other development banks have made, aims precisely at the nexus of development and responding to global challenges – in this case, the learning loss that has resulted from the global COVID pandemic.Using technology, it has helped map enrollment and drop-out rates, supported needs-based teacher training, and freed up teachers from administrative work so they can focus on students.This points to the best of what the World Bank and other development partners can deliver through smartly designed projects that not only lead to tangible outcomes but spur further innovation for the benefit of all.This is why I believe it is absolutely critical that we build on success stories like this by expanding the capacity and balance sheet of the Multilateral Development Banks, or MDBs.Last October I set forth a call to action to the MDBs to do just that. As a result of the steps already taken or under consideration, we believe that the MDBs as a system could unlock $200 billion over the next decade."
90,,"July 16, 2023","As Prepared for DeliveryGood morning, everyone. It’s great to be in India. This is my third time here in less than a year, which means I’ve traveled to India more times than any other country as Treasury Secretary. I’m very glad to be back.I would like to first thank Finance Minister Sitharaman and the Indian delegation for hosting the G20 ministerial. Ahead of the Leaders’ Summit in September, this week’s convening offers us an opportunity to take stock of what we’ve done – and to redouble our efforts to strengthen the global economy, support emerging and developing economies, and tackle global challenges. I’m looking forward to our meetings over the next few days.As you know, I traveled to China last week to meet with the new economic leadership team in place in Beijing. During meetings with my counterparts, I emphasized the importance of both countries working together on the global challenges that face us. As the world’s two largest economies, we have an obligation to the people in our nations and the world to cooperate on areas of mutual concern. Last week’s visit served as a step forward in putting our relationship on surer footing and establishing a resilient and productive channel of communication. There is much more work to do. But I believe this trip was an important start. I am eager to build on the groundwork that we laid in Beijing to mobilize further action.Today, I want to speak about four priorities we will focus on this week: debt distress in emerging markets and developing countries, multilateral development bank evolution, support for Ukraine, and the global tax deal. First, let me speak about how alleviating debt distress can stimulate growth and development – and restore stability in emerging markets and developing countries.As you know, I have pushed hard – both in public and in private – for timely debt treatments for countries in need of relief. Over the past few years, we have seen debt vulnerabilities mount for many countries as a result of the pandemic and Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine. Today, over half of all low-income countries are near or in debt distress. This is double the share of countries that were in this situation in 2015. The economic case for decisive action is clear. When countries find themselves in debt distress, it is hard for them to fund or attract important public and private investments. Without these investments, their macroeconomic foundations deteriorate, making the initial debt problem even worse. Further, with debt service absorbing resources, less is available for essential public spending such as education or healthcare. Restoring debt sustainability can help unlock the massive economic potential of developing nations. It can help them regain lost growth and development and enable them to make investments to address challenges that we are trying to tackle together. When these countries develop and contribute to the global economy, all of us benefit.This week, I will continue to push for full and timely participation of all bilateral official creditors on pending debt restructuring cases. I was pleased by last month’s progress on Zambia, which I discussed with my Chinese counterparts last week. The Zambia agreement took too long to negotiate but it shows that creditors can overcome differences and agree on common principles for debt relief. We should apply the common principles we agreed to in Zambia’s case in other cases – rather than starting at zero every time. And we must go faster. Our hope and expectation are for Ghana and Sri Lanka’s debt treatments to be finalized quickly so that the IMF can move forward with their first program reviews by this fall. I believe that the publication of a user guide for borrower countries can provide necessary clarity and predictability about the debt treatment process. This includes elucidating the principles that all stakeholders agree to adhere to in debt restructuring cases.More broadly, I look forward to working with my counterparts to support macroeconomic stability and growth around the world. The International Monetary Fund plays a critical role through policy guidance. It also plays an important role in providing concessional financing to the world’s poorest countries to support reform efforts. The IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust – the PRGT – is a key facility that currently provides zero-interest rate loans to the poorest countries. The PRGT is especially important today as we navigate a complex economic environment. Low-income countries are under significant fiscal strain. And in many cases, they are seeing stalling or backsliding on important development outcomes. But the PRGT needs to be put on more financially sustainable footing. I expect the IMF to develop a set of options to do so. My team at Treasury is ready to serve as a partner for the IMF as it considers the options at its disposal – like using the internally generated resources of the Fund to support the PRGT subsidy account.Second, I will continue to build momentum for our collective initiative to evolve the multilateral development banks. Ahead of last year’s Annual Meetings, I joined with other shareholders to call for an evolution of the MDB system to address global challenges with the speed and scale required.Over the past few months, our broad coalition has worked with the World Bank management to make significant changes. For example, the World Bank is updating its mission statement and refreshing its operating model. And we are working with the World Bank and the regional development banks to implement measures that will more efficiently leverage the resources they have. Our reforms to the World Bank’s balance sheet will responsibly unlock as much as $50 billion in additional lending capacity over the next decade. As part of our evolution agenda, we estimate that the MDBs as a system could unlock $200 billion over the next decade just from the measures already being implemented or under deliberation. There is potential for even more if the MDBs undertake some of the longer-term and more complex recommendations in the G20 Capital Adequacy Framework report. This is $200 billion more in funding that we can use to advance key global priorities: spurring economic growth and reducing poverty, fighting climate change, and promoting human development.During the Paris Summit last month, I had an opportunity to strengthen our coalition of supporters for this initiative. We were pleased to hear the new World Bank President Ajay Banga announce a package of measures to assist countries in responding to natural disasters, including pausing debt payments. This is particularly important for countries that are especially vulnerable to climate shocks. We now need to translate this momentum into further action.There are a few specific priorities that we should work on next. First, I will work with the World Bank and my counterparts to push for a framework and principles for the targeted use of concessional financing for global challenges. This will enable us to deploy concessional financing toward areas of greatest impact. I will also be talking to counterparts about ideas for how we can help boost the World Bank’s concessional lending for both low-income countries and to support IBRD borrowers as they tackle global challenges like climate. Second, the World Bank should create a mechanism to allocate additional resources to countries that seek Bank financing to combat global challenges. Third, we would like to see the Bank explore options for lending to sub-sovereign and supra-sovereign actors, like COVAX, to address global challenges. Finally, I look forward to collaborating with my counterparts to streamline the climate finance architecture – a significant source of concessional finance – and to make sure that the development banks and specialized funds work together to deliver maximum impact. We need the whole system to become more effective and efficient.As we take these actions, we recognize that public financing alone cannot fully deliver on the massive challenges that face us. That’s why it is essential that development banks ramp up their private capital mobilization rates. I know that this is an imperative shared by President Banga and the leaders of many other MDBs. I encourage them to continue to prioritize these efforts.The recently released G20 MDB Experts Group report is a useful input to the agenda I just described. I am pleased with the report’s emphasis on incorporating global public goods into the mandates of the MDBs – along with its focus on making the operating model of the institutions more responsive through changes to culture, incentives, and risk appetite. I also share the call for much more ambitious private sector engagement and efforts to make the whole system work better together. Finally, I support the request for swift implementation of the Capital Adequacy Framework recommendations. But I believe that we should only explore capital increases after considering the reforms that I laid out along with those in the report. We should build better banks, not just bigger ones.Over the next few months, we will remain intently focused on the delivery of these reforms – in close collaboration with other shareholders.Another key priority this week is to redouble our support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russia’s illegal and unprovoked attack. My visit to Kyiv earlier this year still deeply moves me to this day. Seeing the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian people up close impacted me personally. During the trip, I also saw the massive difference that foreign assistance is making to the lives of Ukrainian civilians and the Ukrainian military’s front lines. As I’ve said, ending this war is first and foremost a moral imperative. But it’s also the single best thing we can do for the global economy.Let me be clear: our coalition’s support for Ukraine is unequivocal. The United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. And I know the allies and partners in our coalition will do so as well. Budgetary support is critical to Ukraine’s resistance. And the United States is proud to be part of a broad coalition that has provided such support to Ukraine. By helping keep the economy and the government running, we are giving Ukraine the support it needs so it can fight for freedom and its sovereignty. We will also continue to cut off Russia’s access to the military equipment and technologies that it needs to wage war against Ukraine. One of our core goals this year is to combat Russia’s efforts to evade our sanctions. Our coalition is building on the actions we’ve taken in recent months to crack down on these efforts.Finally, I want to briefly mention the work we are doing to make our international tax system fairer and fit for purpose in the 21st century. A little less than two years ago, we reached a historic agreement on a Two-Pillar solution to address the tax challenges of our digitalized and globalized economies. We remain committed to implementing that agreement. Today, many countries are moving forward to implement the global minimum tax on the earnings of large multinationals, which will end the race to the bottom on corporate tax rates. It will enable our government and others to implement tax systems that ensure multinationals pay their fair share and compete on a level playing field with small businesses. We continue to work together in the Inclusive Framework to ensure consistent implementation and we expect additional published guidance soon.The Two-Pillar solution also reforms the allocation of taxing rights. It provides greater taxing rights to market jurisdictions in order to better reflect modern economic realities. We are very close to reaching agreement on the technical details of that reallocation, and we are committed to doing so soon.With that, I’ll take your questions."
91,,"July 13, 2023","WASHINGTON- Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen issued the following statement on the appointment of Andrea Gacki as Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Director.“For over two decades and across five presidential administrations, Andrea Gacki has been the consummate public servant. She has demonstrated the very best that Treasury has to offer throughout her various roles with the Department, including serving as acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence for nearly a year. During her time as Director of OFAC, Andrea guided the office through major world events, including most recently, its role countering Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine, where she helped design our unprecedented sanctions strategy. She expertly deploys Treasury’s financial tools, from financial sanctions to industry guidance and enforcement actions, to hold accountable those who threaten our national security and the international financial system. Andrea is simply an unparalleled fighter against the scourge of illicit finance.  As FinCEN embarks on its most ambitious project in recent years – bringing transparency to corporate ownership and protecting the U.S. financial system – there’s no one I trust more to lead the office than Andrea. Andrea’s encyclopedic knowledge of policy, her deep global relationships, and her steady leadership will ensure the Bureau continues to set the international standard for combatting financial crimes.I also thank Himamauli Das for his service as Acting Director of FinCEN during a critical moment in the Bureau’s history, and his leadership across a range of issues, including our response to Russia’s illegal invasion.”"
92,,"July 8, 2023","The relationship between the United States and the People’s Republic of China is one of the most consequential of our time. As the world’s two largest economies, our nations collectively represent 40 percent of the global economy. What we do – both in the bilateral sphere as well as on the broader global stage – shapes the lives and livelihoods of the people in our countries and beyond.I have been intent on speaking about this relationship plainly and honestly: to address the challenges and opportunities that face us based on sober realities. The U.S. and China have significant disagreements. Those disagreements need to be communicated clearly and directly. But President Biden and I do not see the relationship between the U.S. and China through the frame of great power conflict. We believe that the world is big enough for both of our countries to thrive. Both nations have an obligation to responsibly manage this relationship: to find a way to live together and share in global prosperity.Like Secretary Blinken, I came to Beijing to deliver on President Biden’s directive to deepen bilateral communications after his meeting with President Xi last November. My objective during this trip has been to establish and deepen relationships with the new economic leadership team in place in Beijing. Our discussions are part of a broader concerted effort to stabilize the relationship, reduce the risk of misunderstanding, and discuss areas of cooperation.Over the past two days, I have had the chance to do just that. I’ve met with Premier Li, Vice Premier He, Finance Minister Liu, People’s Bank of China Head Pan, and other senior officials to discuss important pillars of our economic relationship. These conversations were direct, substantive, and productive. We were able to learn more about each other’s economies and policy choices, which I believe is vital as the world’s two largest economies. Even where we don’t see eye-to-eye, I believe there is clear value in the frank and in-depth discussions we had on the opportunities and challenges in our relationship, and the better understanding it gave us of each country’s actions and intentions. Broadly speaking, I believe that my bilateral meetings – which totaled about 10 hours over two days – served as a step forward in our effort to put the U.S.-China relationship on surer footing.First, I communicated that President Biden and I seek a future of healthy economic competition between our countries. We believe it is possible to achieve an economic relationship that is mutually beneficial in the long term – one that supports growth and innovation on both sides. Indeed, I noted that China’s growth has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and made clear that the United States is not seeking to decouple from China. There is an important distinction between decoupling, on the one hand, and on the other hand, diversifying critical supply chains or taking targeted national security actions. We know that a decoupling of the world’s two largest economies would be disastrous for both countries and destabilizing for the world. And it would be virtually impossible to undertake. We want a dynamic and healthy global economy that is open, free, and fair – not one that is fragmented or forces countries to take sides.I also communicated to my counterparts that healthy economic competition is only sustainable if it benefits both sides. I pressed them on our serious concerns about China’s unfair economic practices. That includes the breadth and depth of China’s non-market policies, along with barriers to market access for foreign firms and issues involving intellectual property. Fair treatment is critical so American firms and workers compete on a level playing field – and benefit economically from trade and investment with China and the huge market it presents for American goods and services. I also expressed my worries about a recent uptick in coercive actions against American firms.Importantly, I believe that a shift toward a more market-oriented system in China would not only be in the interests of the U.S. and other countries. It would be better for the Chinese economy as well. During this trip, I met with U.S. business leaders who said they would like to see greater economic engagement with China. I also know that many businesses have expressed a range of concerns on the challenges that foreign firms can face here. It is important that we work together to make sure businesses understand there is a wide swath of economic interactions that are uncontroversial to both sides.Second, we also spoke about national security and human rights. I emphasized to my counterparts the necessity of clear and direct communication on the actions we are taking – and why we are taking them. Senior-level engagement is particularly vital during moments of tension. The U.S. will continue to take targeted actions that are necessary to protect our national security interests and those of our allies. As we do so, we adhere to a set of important principles like making sure our national security actions are transparent, narrowly scoped, and targeted to clear objectives. Importantly, these actions are motivated by straightforward national security considerations. They are not used by us to gain economic advantage.I also raised the importance of ending Russia’s brutal and illegal war against Ukraine. As we continue to monitor the domestic situation in Russia, U.S. support for Ukraine will not change. And I communicated that it is essential that Chinese firms avoid providing Russia with material support or assistance with sanctions evasion.Third, we discussed areas where we can work together on global challenges – from tackling the climate crisis to addressing sovereign debt sustainability. This is not a bilateral issue between China and the United States. It is about responsible global leadership. The world deserves and expects its two largest economies to work together on these global problems and help find solutions.We exchanged views on macroeconomic and financial developments in both of our countries. And we shared a common understanding that sustained engagement on these issues was important to maintaining global financial stability. On debt distress in developing countries and emerging markets, we welcomed recent progress on individual cases such as Zambia. I reiterated the importance of timely and comprehensive participation by all bilateral official creditors in other urgent cases. Our Administration believes that improving the debt restructuring process is crucial for the world economy. In addition, we believe that China, as the world’s largest bilateral creditor, can gain from the greater certainty provided by those improvements. We also spoke about the opportunity to work together to mobilize private financing for climate action. And I was able to meet with a group of climate finance leaders in Beijing at a roundtable event. The U.S. Treasury and the People’s Bank of China co-chair the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group, a concrete example of our ability to work together and lead on global challenges. We also spoke about important efforts to modernize our international development finance system.No one visit will solve our challenges overnight. But I expect that this trip will help build a resilient and productive channel of communication with China’s new economic team. Over the past two years, there has been significant public coverage of meetings between our two sides, including my and Secretary Blinken’s visits to China. My hope is that we can move to a phase in our relationship where senior-level diplomacy is simply taken as a natural element of managing one of the world’s most consequential bilateral relationships.Let me end by saying this: navigating the contours of the relationship between the United States and China is no easy task. But we must never forget that, despite the challenges, our path is not predestined. During this trip, I had the opportunity to meet with a group of Chinese women economists. These economists grew up an ocean away from America, but they share much in common with the American economists I’ve worked with throughout my career: a desire to do good work and secure a better future for themselves, their families, and the world. Ultimately, what road we go down in our bilateral relationship is a choice that both countries make. I believe that our two countries must make the right choice for our people and the world: one that advances our shared interest for peace and prosperity."
93,,"July 8, 2023","As Prepared for DeliveryVice Premier He, thank you for welcoming me to Beijing.Last November’s first in-person meeting between President Biden and President Xi provided guidance for us, as senior officials, to enhance our communication and efforts on macroeconomic and financial stability.Amid a complicated global economic outlook, there is a pressing need for the two largest economies to closely communicate and exchange views on our responses to various challenges.This communication can help both sides more fully understand the global economic outlook and make better decisions to strengthen our economies.I also believe that the United States and China should seek a relationship of healthy economic competition that is not winner-take-all, but that, with a fair set of rules, would benefit both countries over time. Where we have concerns about specific economic practices, we should and will communicate them directly.It is my belief that a wide swathe of our economies can interact in ways that are uncontroversial to both governments. The fact that despite recent tensions we set a record for bilateral trade in 2022 suggests there is ample room for our firms to engage in trade and investment.We also face important global challenges, such as debt distress in emerging markets and developing countries and climate change, where we have a duty to both our own countries and to other countries to cooperate.Finally, the United States will take targeted actions to protect our national security. While we may disagree on these actions, we should not allow that disagreement to lead to misunderstandings, particularly those stemming from a lack of communication, which can unnecessarily worsen our bilateral economic and financial relationship.I look forward to our discussion. "
94,,"July 8, 2023","As Prepared for DeliveryIt’s great to see all of you. Thank you for joining me for lunch.I am in Beijing at this critical time because, for all the disagreements between our nations, President Biden and I believe it is in the best interests of our peoples to put our relationship on a better track and to maintain open and honest lines of communication.I strongly believe that the relationship between our two countries is rooted in the solid ties between the American and Chinese people. It is important that we keep nurturing and deepening these ties, especially as China reopens after three years of COVID lockdowns.Let me be clear: while the U.S. has differences with the Chinese government, these are not disagreements with the Chinese people.In fact, we are proud to have millions of Chinese immigrants in the United States who enrich our communities.We are eager to welcome Chinese tourists to our country, and Chinese students to our schools and universities. China remains among the most represented countries among international students in the United States.Our people share many things in common – far more than our differences. I understand that you are economists. As you may know, I am an economist too. I began my career in economics in the 1970s, and pursued a career in labor economics before becoming a central banker and now Treasury Secretary.Over the course of my career, I’ve seen how China’s adoption of market-based economic policies has transformed the country and lifted many hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.It is my hope for the benefit of both China and the United States, as well as for the broader global economy, that those policies are carried out moving forward.I know we share similar stories and experiences about what a career in economics is like, and the challenges you can face when you’re the only woman in the room or at the decision-making table.I am eager to hear about your backgrounds and research, including what got you interested in economics in the first place and how you see your career progressing.Thank you again for taking time to join me, and I look forward to our lunch."
95,,"July 7, 2023","I am in Beijing at this critical time because, while there are disagreements between our nations, President Biden and I believe it is in the best interests of our peoples to put our relationship on a better track and to maintain open and honest lines of communication.This is particularly important for tackling longstanding global challenges that threaten us all. As the two largest economies in the world, it is in our interest to work together on these challenges, and it is something the world expects of us.History shows us what our two countries can do: moments of cooperation on climate between the United States and China have made global breakthroughs possible, including the Paris Agreement.Both our countries seek to support partners in emerging markets and developing countries as they strive to meet their climate goals, and I believe continued U.S.-China cooperation on climate finance is critical.As the world’s two largest emitters of greenhouse gases and the largest investors in renewable energy, we have both a joint responsibility – and ability – to lead the way.Climate finance should be targeted efficiently and effectively. I believe that if China were to support existing multilateral climate institutions like the Green Climate Fund and the Climate Investment Funds alongside us and other donor governments, we could have a greater impact than we do today.It is also critical that we encourage economy-wide transitions toward net-zero, which needs to include the private sector. We should work to increase and improve climate-aligned investment in ways that are interoperable to our different systems.I was pleased last month to join colleagues from around the world, including Premier Li Qiang, at the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris. The Summit was an important political moment in our 2023 agenda to advance action on global challenges, including climate.At the upcoming Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting, I look forward to receiving recommendations put forth by the various working groups – including the Sustainable Finance Working Group, which the United States and China co-chair.Over the last three years, the Sustainable Finance Working Group has developed a roadmap for sustainable finance, held workshops on carbon pricing and non-pricing policy levers, developed a transition finance framework, and made a range of recommendations on climate finance. This is a good of example of what our bilateral cooperation can achieve – and we should build on it in multilateral forums.This extends from government-to-government platforms to forums convened of academic, think tank, private sector, and non-government experts such as yourselves. For instance, I know several of you participate in the so-called U.S.-China Track II Dialogue on Climate Finance.I look forward to hearing more about that work today, and other views you have on how we can better cooperate on climate change and climate finance specifically, given that the changing climate affects all countries, with the most vulnerable facing the most negative impacts."

Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
97,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
98,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

100,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
101,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

102,,"July 7, 2023","Last November, President Biden and President Xi met in Bali for their first in-person presidential meeting. They emphasized that senior officials from our countries should deepen constructive efforts on macroeconomic stability and address shared global challenges.I am in Beijing to build on that direction. I recently delivered a speech that laid out the Administration’s economic approach towards China. We seek healthy economic competition that is not winner-take-all but that, with a fair set of rules, can benefit both countries over time.There are also important global challenges where the United States and China have a duty both to our own countries and to the world to cooperate and show leadership.The United States will, in certain circumstances, need to pursue targeted actions to protect its national security. And we may disagree in these instances.However, we should not allow any disagreement to lead to misunderstandings that unnecessarily worsen our bilateral economic and financial relationship.I agree with what you said in your speech at the World Economic Forum that “differences should not be a cause for estrangement, but a driver for more communication and exchange.”"
103,,"July 7, 2023","I am here in Beijing to carry forward President Biden’s directive from his meeting with President Xi last November to deepen our communications with China, including on economic issues.We believe that it is in the best interests of both countries to make sure we have direct and clear lines of communication at senior levels. In the economic realm, regular exchanges with our Chinese counterparts can help us monitor economic and financial risks, and it can help create the conditions for a healthy economic relationship between our two countriesI believe that’s particularly important right now as the global economy faces headwinds like Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine and the lingering effects of the pandemic.As I said in my speech in April, the U.S. seeks healthy economic competition with China. But healthy economic competition – where both sides benefit – is only sustainable if that competition is fair.During meetings with my counterparts, I am communicating the concerns that I’ve heard from the U.S. business community – including China’s use of non-market tools like expanded subsidies for its state-owned enterprises and domestic firms, as well as barriers to market access for foreign firms. I’ve been particularly troubled by punitive actions that have been taken against U.S. firms in recent months.I am also concerned about new export controls recently announced by China on two critical minerals used in technologies like semiconductors. We are still evaluating the impact of these actions, but they remind us of the importance of building resilient and diversified supply chains.Our economic relationship with China must work for American workers and businesses. I will always champion your interests and work to make sure there is a level playing field. This includes coordinating with our allies to respond to China’s unfair economic practices.I also think that a shift toward market reforms would be in China’s interests. A market-based approach helped spur rapid growth in China and helped lift hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. This is a remarkable economic success story.Many of your firms understand how a level playing field can benefit both of our countries. China has an enormous and growing middle-class, with consumers who are eager to consume American goods and services.I have made clear that the United States does not seek a wholesale separation of our economies. We seek to diversify, not to decouple. A decoupling of the world’s two largest economies would be destabilizing for the global economy, and it would be virtually impossible to undertake.I also made clear that actions we take to protect our national security are designed to be narrowly targeted – and that they are premised on straightforward national security considerations and not undertaken to gain economic advantage over China.In fact, trade between our two countries reached an all-time high last year. And if it is fair, trade and investment can support American jobs at home and promote American innovation. A stable and constructive relationship between the U.S. and China is in the interests of American workers and businesses.I look forward to hearing from you today about your plans in China, as well as how China’s policies and practices are impacting your business operations."
104,,"June 30, 2023","Let me first thank the organizers of the Essence Festival for inviting me to be the first Treasury Secretary to join this forum. I appreciate all of you for being here today – and for taking time away from the music and other attractions. I know that hip-hop icons like Megan Thee Stallion are playing in the next few days – and that I am just a warm-up act for them.Before I begin, I want to express my disappointment in the Supreme Court’s decision yesterday, effectively striking down decades of precedent on affirmative action. Diversity is a core strength of our country. I spent a significant part of my career on university campuses – and I know that our entire community benefits when our student bodies reflect all of America. Our Administration has announced swift actions in the wake of the Court’s decision. And I believe the decision underscores the urgency of redoubling our work to promote opportunity for all Americans – in and beyond our educational system. As the Secretary of the Treasury, I am responsible for promoting a strong American economy and expanding economic opportunity for all. My interest in economics started when I was young. I grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Brooklyn. My father was a doctor. His office was on the ground floor of our house. When I was little, his patients would take the bus up from their jobs in the factories or the docks to see him. Over the years, his patients became our friends. I’d learn about their lives as they came by – challenges at work and at home, as well as the heartbreak of losing a job and the difficulty of finding one in the first place. My parents were also children of the Great Depression. From a young age, they taught me about how financial hardship can cause immense pain.It was an early lesson on why economics is not the dry subject it is typically thought to be. In fact, economic wellbeing has a profound consequence on people’s lives and livelihoods. That is what motivated me to pursue a career in economics. And it is what motivates me every day in my job – to tackle the persistent economic challenges that have long faced underserved communities. I know the people in this room do not need me to tell you, but it’s important that I acknowledge this up front: the economy has never operated on a fair playing field for Black communities and other communities of color. Wealth and income disparities have persisted since I began my work as an economist in the seventies. During my tenure as Treasury Secretary, we have taken significant steps to build a fairer economy. And even as there is more to do, we have made progress. Over the past couple of years, the Black unemployment rate has fallen to historic lows. The number of Black active business owners jumped 9 percent from the start of 2021 to the end of 2022. And we saw a huge decline in poverty for Black children in 2021, driven in large part by our policies.Today, I want to share with you what we’ve done – and what more there is to do. I strongly believe that our racial equity work is not just the morally right thing to do. It’s in the best economic interests of our entire country. When President Biden and I took office in January 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic was still raging. The Black unemployment rate had peaked at over 16 percent during the previous year. We faced the prospect that a significant portion of Americans could remain unemployed for the long term. We also faced the risk of a tsunami of evictions that could have left many Americans without a home. Black women were especially at risk during the pandemic. One in three worked in front-line jobs that put them at dual health and economic risk. During my trips across the country, I heard from Black small business owners about the fear that they felt when the pandemic hit. They told me how the businesses they worked their entire lives to build felt like they were at the brink of collapsing in a matter of weeks.  In response, President Biden took decisive action. With the partnership of Congress, we enacted a Rescue Plan to support families, keep businesses open, and ensure that critical services could continue to function.For example, we’ve delivered nearly 11 million household payments to renters in need. We worked with state and local governments to make sure that funds went to those most in need. For example, Jefferson County, Alabama partnered with housing counseling agencies with a track record of serving Black households. The results speak for themselves. The vast majority of emergency rental assistance went to very low-income households. More than 40 percent went to Black families. By targeting those most in need, we were able to improve the overall effectiveness of the program. The fact that we averted massive evictions and foreclosures is a particularly enormous achievement in a downturn that was characterized by such a rapid spike in layoffs and furloughs. Just as we faced the possibility of a tsunami of evictions, the pandemic also threatened to throw many thousands of children into poverty. In response, we expanded the Child Tax Credit in 2021. That enabled tens of millions of families to receive hundreds of dollars per child in monthly support. The program is credited for bringing over 700,000 Black children out of poverty in 2021. And it cut overall child poverty almost in half that year to its lowest level on record. Today, we can safely say that our economic recovery from the pandemic has been historically inclusive and broad-based. For instance, the Hispanic unemployment rate hit a record low last September. And the Black unemployment rate did the same earlier this year. This is a significant achievement.And it’s not only a big achievement for communities of color. It benefits our entire economy. I believe that intentional polices focused on driving an inclusive recovery have helped our economy withstand the challenges of the past two years. Put simply, our quick and sustained labor market recovery has served as a source of strength not only for local communities – but for the broader U.S. economy as well. Our economy remains fractured by zip code – with persistent disparities by race and ethnicity. We all know the adage: talent is equally distributed, but opportunity is not. President Biden and I are putting in place an ambitious economic plan. Our plan is designed to invest in people and places that are full of potential but lack resources – providing a generational opportunity for these communities to build wealth. By making investments in communities most in need, our plan is putting our federal dollars to best use and catalyzing strong, sustainable economic growth for all.We have prioritized working with minority-owned banks and others that have a track record of delivering capital to underserved communities. To date, our Emergency Capital Investment Program has invested more than $1.4 billion in Black-owned and operated banks and credit unions. We project that our program’s investments will increase lending in Black communities by nearly $80 billion over the next decade. In April, we also deployed the largest grant round in our CDFI Fund’s history. We distributed $1.7 billion in awards to over 600 community lenders. This included funding for Liberty Financial Services, which is a part of Liberty Bank. It’s one of the nation’s largest Black-owned banks – headquartered right here in New Orleans. We are also enhancing the impact of our public investments through our work with a group of companies and foundations called the Economic Opportunity Coalition. This Coalition recently reached its goal of securing $1 billion in deposits into community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions. This will enable them to further expand their lending – so families can afford new homes and businesses can grow. Across our programs, we believe that our targeted loans and grants can help fuel the success of underserved communities, including helping build generational wealth. We are also working through states to deliver financing to Black-owned businesses. Small businesses serve as the backbone of many neighborhoods. They create local jobs and sustain the social fabric of many communities. Our State Small Business Credit Initiative allocates nearly $10 billion to expand access to capital for small businesses. In Wichita, Kansas, our program helped fund a startup called WorkTorch – a pioneering career platform for service workers. The company’s founders are the first Black women in Kansas to raise over $1 million in seed funding. Additionally, our Administration has committed to increase the federal government’s contracts with minority-owned and other small disadvantaged businesses. We are leveraging the power of the federal government – which is the single largest purchaser of goods and services in the world. Last year, Treasury awarded nearly $200 million in prime contracts to Black-owned businesses. That’s a 60 percent increase from 2020.Lastly, my Department is working to implement the Inflation Reduction Act. This law is the boldest climate action that the nation has ever taken. It also serves as a historic economic investment. One of the core goals of the Inflation Reduction Act is to ensure that all Americans benefit from the growth of the clean energy economy. To do so, we are implementing provisions that incentivize companies to invest in low-income communities and adopt strong labor standards. Across the country, we are seeing a boom in new projects up and down the clean energy supply chain. These projects are creating new good-paying jobs in some of the most cutting-edge industries. For that reason, we have worked to build our internal capacity. We’ve established the Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity – a first-of-its-kind committee that brings in outside perspectives to inform our racial equity work. We’ve hosted important dialogues on community and economic development, including relaunching the annual Freedman’s Bank Forum. We’ve stood up the first Office of Tribal and Native Affairs to strengthen our relationship with Indian Country. We’ve expanded our demographic data collection and reporting efforts across a broad range of programs. That’s helping us determine the impact of our work and hold ourselves accountable for our policies. And I cannot help but mention that Treasury’s leadership in this Administration has been the most diverse than at any other point since the Department was founded in 1789. I’m proud of our Administration’s work to deliver for Black and other underserved communities. But little of what I’ve described to you today would have been possible without our trusted partners – many of whom are in this room. Thank you to those of you who have informed our work; served as our connections to communities across the country; and extended the reach of the historic investments we are making. Our work is only beginning. And we need the partnership of everyone in this room. The historic investments that our Administration is making are presenting generational opportunities for workers and entrepreneurs across the country. We are committed to working with you to empower Black Americans to seize these opportunities and enable their full participation in our economic future. "
105,,"June 30, 2023","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the kind introduction. I’m grateful to be here in Louisiana. There is no better place to speak about the economic future we are building than in the New Orleans area – known for its energy and dynamism. I am thankful for the warm welcome from Ben, Tom, and the PosiGen team. I’m here to speak about President Biden’s historic economic agenda. Over the past year and a half, the President has signed three consequential bills into law: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. The passage of one of these laws by itself would be a significant accomplishment. But as the President laid out in his speech on Wednesday, these laws together constitute one of the most important economic investments our country has ever made.During my travels across the country, I have already seen the early impacts of these laws on American families and businesses. I see them here in Louisiana too. The President’s economic agenda advances a wide range of goals: bolstering our nation’s manufacturing and infrastructure, boosting competition, enhancing resilience and security, extending our nation’s global technological leadership, and mitigating climate change. But today, I want to focus on how it is creating good jobs, broadening economic opportunity, and improving our long-term economic outlook. The President’s agenda – “Bidenomics” – is rooted in an economic framework that I call “modern supply-side economics.” This framework is aimed at expanding the productive capacity of the American economy.Before I discuss these investments, it’s worth first speaking about what made them possible to begin with: our historic economic recovery from the pandemic. As the President said on Wednesday, our Administration came into office at a moment of unprecedented uncertainty about the American economy. A once-in-a-century pandemic had triggered a once-in-a-generation economic collapse. There was no tried-and-true playbook for how to manage the dual public health and economic crises that we faced. But the President knew that decisive action was necessary. So, our Administration acted. We launched a vaccination campaign to put shots in arms. And we enacted the American Rescue Plan to enable households, businesses, and state and local governments to weather the economic storm. Our economy has endured numerous recessions over the past few decades. During every downturn, one of the biggest fears is scarring in the labor market – that is, that Americans who were thrown out of work during the immediate crisis would stay unemployed for the long term. It’s a crippling fate that plagued millions of Americans in the aftermath of the Great Recession. But we saw very few signs of scarring during this recovery. In fact, our nation’s unemployment rate has fallen to historic lows. Over the past two and a half years, over 13 million jobs have been created – including nearly 800,000 manufacturing jobs. Here in Louisiana, employment is up over 110,000 jobs from January 2021. The portion of prime working-age Americans in our workforce is the highest it has been in over 15 years. And that measure for women recently reached an all-time high. Importantly, our recovery has been broad-based and inclusive. Today, the unemployment rates for Black and Hispanic Americans are at among their lowest points on record. I’m looking forward to speaking more about our historically equitable recovery later today at the Essence Festival in New Orleans. Of course, we still face serious challenges – including some in the short term. But our Administration has stayed laser-focused on them. While inflation remains too high, we have seen meaningful progress. Annual headline inflation is down 11 months in a row, even as our labor market remains especially resilient. This means that Americans are getting a bit more breathing room from the higher price increases that plagued us last summer. Of course, our work is not over. We will continue to take actions to expand overall supply and provide cost relief to Americans where we can. As I’ve said, our goal is to tackle inflation while protecting the economic gains of the past two and a half years. For a year now, we have heard our fair share of predictions about an imminent U.S. recession – with forecasters projecting one by the end of 2022, then by the start of 2023, then by the middle of this year. But our economy has proven more resilient than many had thought. I continue to believe that there is a path to reducing inflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. Without downplaying the significant risks ahead, the evidence that we’ve seen so far suggests that we are on that path. This sentiment is echoed by business executives I’ve met with, who have increasingly voiced confidence in our economy. While there are parts of our economy that are slowing down, households are spending at a robust pace and businesses continue to invest. Going forward, I expect the current strength of the labor market and robust household and business balance sheets to serve as a source of economic strength, even if our economy does cool a bit more as inflation falls.  Of course, significant uncertainty remains. But the American economy is in a better place than many would have thought at this time last year. And it’s certainly in a better place than most reasonable people would have expected when we entered office in January 2021.As our economy continues to transition to steady and healthy growth, I believe that we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the future. Last year, I laid out an economic framework that encapsulates my views about how the President’s economic agenda will grow our economy. It’s called modern supply-side economics. Our Administration’s modern supply-side policies prioritize investments in our workforce and its productivity – in order to raise the ceiling for what our economy can produce. As the President outlined on Wednesday, our economic approach sits in steep contrast with traditional supply-side economics, which focuses primarily on providing tax cuts to spur greater private investment. In many cases, this approach has not only failed to boost growth as promised. It has also contributed to deepening income and wealth disparities and environmental damage. Unlike the traditional approach, modern supply-side policies focus both on a range of productivity-boosting investments – as well as its distribution across people and places.President Biden has advanced a significant core of the modern supply-side agenda through the enactment of three historic laws: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. We are already seeing their early results. This week, Treasury released a study that shows that real construction spending in manufacturing has doubled since the end of 2021. Importantly, that’s not driven by the impact of higher prices. We are actually seeing a remarkable surge in factory construction in the United States.  President Biden’s economic agenda will expand our economy’s productive capacity and bolster our economic resilience. Take infrastructure. Economists broadly agree that investing in public infrastructure can boost productivity and growth. Yet one in five miles of highways and major roads in America are in poor condition. Your former mayor, Mitch Landrieu, is coordinating an Administration-wide effort to rebuild not only traditional infrastructure like roads and bridges, but also digital infrastructure like high-speed Internet. Louisiana was the first state to be awarded broadband funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. And major projects like the replacement of the I-10 Calcasieu River Bridge are being made possible with federal funds. These efforts will facilitate the efficient movement of people, goods, and ideas. It will boost our long-term economic outlook – with broad benefits for American families, workers, and businesses. Our agenda is also investing in economic resilience. Semiconductors are tiny inputs that have large implications for our economy and national security. Conventional technologies like toasters, refrigerators, and cars rely on a steady supply of semiconductors. So too do cutting-edge military technologies. But the United States only makes up 12 percent of global semiconductor production. That’s down from 37 percent three decades ago. We have seen the acute impacts of a disruption to chip supply on our economy. A chip shortage during the pandemic cost the U.S. economy an estimated $240 billion in 2021 alone. To mitigate future shocks, we are building a semiconductor ecosystem here at home. And that ecosystem is already growing. The recent boom in manufacturing construction is principally driven by computer, electronic, and electrical manufacturing, which has nearly quadrupled since the start of last year. Our economic agenda is helping close the financing gap between chip manufacturing in the U.S. and abroad. Put simply, we are helping companies build the case for investing here at home.Importantly, our resilience agenda is transforming communities across America. Expansions of their domestic footprint by companies like Intel, IBM, and Micron are having significant implications for local communities. One analysis shows that nearly half of the jobs in the semiconductor industry do not require a bachelor’s or graduate degree. According to one estimate, over 50 new semiconductor ecosystem projects have been announced in the wake of the CHIPS Act. These projects will create thousands of good-paying jobs. Treasury took a big step this month to provide manufacturers with even greater certainty to invest in America – by setting clear rules of the road for investors seeking to take advantage of the CHIPS investment tax credit. American workers have long been part of a proud tradition of science and innovation. We are now cementing their leadership at the forefront of one of this century’s most significant technologies.As we implement these laws, our guiding principle has been to make sure that these investments broaden economic opportunity – not just on the East and West Coasts, but across the entire country. Treasury is leading the implementation of the clean energy provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act. The IRA is a historic environmental law: the boldest climate action this country has ever taken and a crucial step toward building true energy security. But it’s also a generational economic law. Clean energy presents one of the most transformative economic opportunities in modern history. We are making sure that the clean energy transition will bring along every community – particularly those that were at risk of being left behind.Since the law passed last summer, we have seen tens of billions of dollars in investments up and down the clean energy supply chain. I’ve seen how the green economy is driving a renewal in many communities firsthand during my travels across the country – from a solar panel company in North Carolina to an EV battery plant in Tennessee. Communities in the Midwest and the South are seeing such a boom in gigafactory investments that commentators are speaking of the rise of an EV “battery belt.” Here in Louisiana, companies like PosiGen are benefiting from the greater certainty that the IRA provides for their future business plans, as well as increased demand for their products. Earlier this week, GM announced a deal with Element 25 to process critical minerals from Australia right here in Louisiana. It will be the first plant of its kind in the United States. And it will help GM scale the production of its electric vehicles in North America beyond one million units annually.  This broad progress has not come by happenstance. It is the result of deliberate policy design and execution. The Inflation Reduction Act incentivizes companies to invest in underserved communities. It also incentivizes investments in communities that have been at the forefront of energy production and experienced job loss, including many communities here in Louisiana. We are also making sure that the workers building the clean energy economy actually benefit from it.  For the first time, companies must satisfy strong labor standards to qualify for an enhanced tax credit. That means paying their workers prevailing wages and hiring registered apprentices. President Biden has been an ardent champion for American workers throughout his career. The Inflation Reduction Act’s strong labor provisions build on other work that we are doing to empower and train workers – including through the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS and Science Act.This month, Treasury took a major step toward expanding the reach of these clean energy tax incentives. We know that the clean energy transition will take trillions of dollars. The federal government cannot do it alone. We recently issued proposed rules that extend the benefits of clean energy credits directly to states, cities, and towns – and to tax-exempt organizations like hospitals, schools, charities, and other nonprofits. And we also created new opportunities for many more startups and early-stage companies to take advantage of these incentives. These steps serve as a force multiplier. They mean that more clean energy projects will be built quickly and affordably. More communities will feel the IRA’s massive economic benefits. To close: I am proud of what the President and our Administration has accomplished in the two and a half years since taking office. We have rescued the economy from the depths of an unprecedented crisis. Now, we are investing in our future. To do so, we are capitalizing on the greatest strengths of our nation and our people: we are building. We are innovating. And as the President likes to say, we are working to grow the economy “from the bottom up and the middle out.” As modern supply-side economics demonstrates, that’s not just a talking point: that’s smart economics. While we face significant challenges, I hope you feel proud – as I do – about how far we’ve come, as well as the possibility that lies ahead. I am hopeful of the America that we are building together. "
106,,"June 23, 2023","Thank you, President Macron.  And good morning, everyone.  It is great to be with you today to discuss the important question of how we align our efforts to reduce poverty with our efforts to combat climate change and other global challenges. It is clear from this Summit that we all share the goal of securing a more prosperous, healthy, and livable planet.  It is also clear that there is political will and commitment to multilateralism to translate intentions into action. Indeed, I am pleased to share this stage with colleagues from around the world, including Premier Li Qiang. As I said in a speech earlier in the year, as the world’s two largest economies, we also have a responsibility to work together on global issues. It is something the world expects of us.Last fall, we launched an initiative to evolve the multilateral development banks – or MDBs – to better address global challenges like climate change, pandemics, fragility and conflict.  During this process, we have sometimes heard concerns about a tradeoff between addressing these challenges and accelerating investments in health, education or poverty alleviation.But I strongly believe that is a false choice.  The MDBs must do both – and do both well.  That’s because countries cannot make sustained progress on poverty eradication and the sustainable development goals if they do not invest in building resilience to these global shocks. If one thing is certain in our world, it is that these shocks will come.Indeed, global challenges are increasing in scope and complexity.  They disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable, and they are intimately intertwined with national challenges.   Climate change is dampening agricultural yields and driving food insecurity in many parts of the world.  I saw this on full display when I visited three African countries earlier this year.Indeed, the smallholder farmers I visited in Zambia described the toll that extreme weather events and floods are taking on their livelihoods. They made no distinction between these global challenges and national challenges.  In addition, threats to global health disrupt entire societies and economies, with the pandemic leading to the first global increase in extreme poverty in decades.And, conflict not only causes immense human suffering, but also stunts economic growth and contributes to the significant displacement of people across regions.That is why it is imperative that we evolve the MDBs to respond to global challenges with sufficient speed and scale.  Doing any less is a disservice to the rest of the development agenda.The World Bank has updated its mission to account for the fact that addressing global challenges is critical to achieving the Twin Goals of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.In addition, the World Bank is integrating global challenges into its diagnostic work, country engagement, and corporate scorecard, which will help engrain work to address these challenges into the institution’s DNA. And, the Bank is responsibly stretching its balance sheet and pursuing innovative measures to unlock up to $50 billion in additional lending capacity over the next ten years.  As part of our agenda, we believe that MDBs could, as a system, unlock $200 billion in new lending capacity over the same timeframe through balance sheet measures that are either already under implementation or being deliberated.We began the evolution initiative at the World Bank.  But we have always recognized that maximizing its impact requires an evolution across the MDB system, and even beyond to cover the funds.The MDBs are vital multilateral tools to help us face the demands of our changing world.  Yet they would be even more effective if they were to work better together as a system, each operating with its relative strengths and expertise, and in concert with others and also in better partnership with the private sector, philanthropies and civil society. We have the necessary ingredients to make real progress – political leadership, creativity, innovative financing mechanisms, and the openness and courage to learn from the past as well as to forge new solutions for the future.  With strong collective action across all shareholders, management, and other critical partners like the African Union, we can help meet the aspirations of people around the world."
107,,"June 23, 2023","This Summit is an important milestone in our effort to evolve the global financial architecture to be more responsive to the challenges and opportunities facing us.  First, our initiative to evolve the multilateral development banks, or MDBs.  Global challenges like climate, pandemics, and fragility and conflict are putting development gains at risk.  And we are unlocking as much as $50 billion in additional lending capacity over the next decade.  Our estimate is that the MDBs – as a system – could unlock $200 billion in new lending capacity over the same timeframe through balance sheet measures that are either already under implementation or being deliberated.That by itself is a significant achievement.  We could have $200 billion in lending capacity that we didn’t have before to invest in some of the most pressing problems facing the world – combatting climate change, lifting people out of poverty, preparing for future pandemics, and much more.  Second, debt and macroeconomic stability.  The IMF plays an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance along with critical financing.We call on the IMF to present all available options to put its Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility on sustainable footing in the near-term by the Annual Meetings. To that end, I’m pleased that all official bilateral creditors have reached consensus to move forward with a debt treatment for Zambia, under the leadership of the Chinese and French co-chairs.  I just saw Premier Li at the high-level panel and am encouraged that China is moving to help address the debt challenges facing developing countries.Beyond resolving outstanding cases, a productive first step to provide greater certainty and timeliness to the debt process would be the publication of a guide to the Common Framework for borrowers.As we announced earlier this morning, the Investor Leadership Network, which includes companies with a total of over $10 trillion in assets under management, has launched a new commitment to accelerate pension fund and institutional investments in emerging and developing economies over the next three years.I also continue to believe that MDBs should launch a set of more innovation tools to boost private capital mobilization, which is a priority shared by many leaders of these institutions – like President Banga.We have already taken significant complementary action.  Through the G7, we seek to mobilize $600 billion for high quality infrastructure investment through public and private funds over five years.  The United States has already achieved $30 billion of its $200 billion commitment.And through initiatives like Just Energy Transition Partnerships, we’re bringing public and private sources of funding together to provide tens of billions of dollars to fight climate change and spur economic development in emerging economies.The challenge to the world that has brought us here to Paris is make sure the global financial architecture can orient the necessary finance towards the essential tasks of eradicating poverty, combatting climate change, and building a global economy that allows people and the planet to thrive. "
108,,"June 23, 2023","Thank you, Ambassador Bauer, for co-hosting this breakfast. I am glad to have a more intimate opportunity to discuss multilateral development bank evolution and how it will help us meet the challenges we face as a global community in the 21st century.The global shocks we have collectively endured over the last three years, many of which stem from global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict, have taken a terrible toll in terms of lives lost, livelihoods disrupted, rising poverty, and slower economic growth.These global challenges are increasing in scope and complexity, disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable. They threaten to roll back past hard-won development gains and impede the gains we hope to make in the future.Equipping these institutions to respond to global challenges with sufficient speed and scale is integral to supporting emerging market and developing countries in their fight against poverty and for inclusive, sustainable, and resilient development.In the nine months since we issued the call to evolve the MDBs, we have made significant initial progress at the World Bank in refreshing its mission and reforming its operational and financial models. And we have begun rolling this agenda out to the regional development banks.And, in addition to our existing commitments to the MDBs, the United States is working to enable new concessional World Bank financing to incentivize additional action on global challenges and to provide enhanced support to low-income countries. In short, our commitment to address the 21st century needs and challenges of emerging markets and developing countries is strong.While building resilience is central to evolution, what I also hear from partners in the developing world is that they want and need the MDBs to support them by delivering solutions to the challenges they face with greater speed and agility. And they need the banks to better draw in the private sector and to work better together.We have also called for strengthening the World Bank’s efforts to mobilize private capital at scale. This means creating incentives for staff that reward mobilization rather than use of the Bank’s own resources, setting ambitious mobilization targets that could drive a shift in operations toward achieving them, and refining instruments and approaches like guarantees, securitization, and asset recycling.Today, we are proud to announce that the Investor Leadership Network, which includes companies with a total of over $10 trillion in assets under management, has launched a new commitment to accelerate pension fund and institutional investments in emerging and developing economies over the next three years.The Network aims to broaden and deepen private sector financing, including through co-investments with MDBs, in the critical areas of energy transition and sustainable infrastructure. My team will be working closely with them to facilitate these investments.We are confident that Ajay Banga will pursue the evolution agenda with vigor as World Bank President. Given his background managing large, complex institutions and track record of forging partnerships between the public sector, private sector, and non-profits, he is uniquely equipped to do so.And, to maximize the impact of the evolution initiative, we need the MDBs to work better together as a system, each operating with its relative strengths and expertise, and in concert with the others.The MDBs are among the most powerful tools we have in facing the demands of our changing world, and none of them alone can solve poverty, deliver the Sustainable Development Goals, or address global challenges.All this is to say that the evolution reforms carry wide-ranging benefits for all MDB shareholders – borrowers and non-borrowers, middle- and low-income countries. And it is important that each of us do our part so that the outcomes of these reforms are robust, transformative, and palpable to people and businesses in partner countries."
109,,"June 22, 2023","PARIS- Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement following Zambia reaching a debt restructuring agreement with official creditors.“I welcome the consensus that official creditors have reached on providing a debt treatment to Zambia,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen.  “During my trip to Zambia earlier this year, I saw firsthand how the weight of default and a stalled debt restructuring process can bring suffering to ordinary families and hold back economic growth. Debt relief for Zambia has been a top priority for me and has been something I have pushed for urgently both in public and in private with creditors. I am pleased that the international community has come together to support Zambia in its time of need.  I urge all official bilateral and private sector creditors to quickly finalize the debt restructuring process that will provide relief to Zambian families and encourage the private investment that is needed to jump start the economy.”"
110,,"June 22, 2023","Today’s development landscape is challenging. Over the past few years, we have experienced significant macroeconomic shocks. This has impacted the global growth outlook for developing countries.These effects are compounded by longstanding global challenges, such as climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict. These global challenges have had an outsized impact on emerging market and developing countries. And they are increasingly putting at risk our shared goals of poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth.The World Bank and the regional development banks have long been integral partners to developing countries, including those without any significant market access. They bring knowledge and technical advice. And, they bring finance when times are tough. They have been able to play this role because these institutions have constantly evolved to meet the challenges of their time.It is time for them to evolve again. The world has changed. In the 21st century, some of the challenges that are most threatening to the poorest and most vulnerable among us are global.We have learned the hard way from COVID-19 and other transboundary challenges that countries cannot sustainably bring down poverty rates and invest in their growth if they constantly face shocks from climate change, pandemics, or conflict.MDBs need to evolve to incorporate addressing these global challenges into their work. This includes reforming their vision, incentives structures, operating model, and financing capacity to help countries fight these challenges and build resilience.Last October, I called for an evolution of the MDB system to do just that. Since then, a broad and growing coalition of shareholders have been working with management to enact important reforms.Second, the World Bank is integrating global challenges into its diagnostic work, country strategies, and corporate scorecard. This means, for example, that new infrastructure will be built to withstand extreme weather events – so that when a typhoon or hurricane strikes, roads will still be open to emergency vehicles and hospitals will still have electricity. There will be less disruption to economic activity.Third, the Bank is responsibly stretching its balance sheet to unlock up to $50 billion over the next ten years. This represents a nearly 20 percent boost in sustainable annual lending. And it is close to the increase in annual lending that resulted from the 2018 capital package. This is value for money.It is vital that we continue to adopt additional reforms on a rolling basis. I would like to highlight three planks of action that should be prioritized next.The World Bank should develop a framework and principles for the targeted use of concessional resources – so that financing to address global challenges is deployed to where it has the highest impact.The Bank should offer borrowers the option to add climate-resilient debt clauses to their loan agreements – so they have a greater buffer if a climate-related event strikes.Second, we must leverage opportunities to bring the MDB evolution agenda to the regional development banks. We are seeing important innovations begin to take shape across the African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, IDB Group, and others.We want this Summit to accelerate progress. We intend to build momentum for additional reforms throughout the year – leveraging the G20 Leaders Summit, Marrakech Annual Meetings, and COP28 as major milestones.Let me end with a clear message: evolving the MDBs is not about displacing the institutions’ core development work and anti-poverty efforts. Rather, it is about equipping the Banks to sustain progress on this work by building resilience to new global shocks."
111,,"June 22, 2023","I’m glad to be here in Paris. Let me begin by expressing my thanks to President Macron, Finance Minister Le Maire, and the French delegation for hosting this Summit. We meet at a moment of tremendous promise and challenge. In recent decades, developing countries have seen broad economic progress. But over the past few years, that progress has stagnated. Since 2020, the world has endured a series of shocks. We’ve seen a once-in-a-century pandemic and the largest land war in Europe since World War II – occurring against the backdrop of increasingly frequent and severe climate disasters. These recent shocks have led to millions of lives lost and livelihoods eroded. Further, they threaten to deepen economic divergence between advanced and developing economies. Advanced economies have generally had fiscal space and resources to support their economies and protect their people from the economic impacts of these shocks. In contrast, low-income countries are under significantly greater fiscal strain. They are projected to sustain the largest output loss of all economies in the medium term. This situation means that more people are at risk of being thrown into poverty. And health and educational outcomes may further stall or reverse.  At this critical moment, President Biden has directed his Administration to deliver on a comprehensive approach to support our developing country partners. This approach recognizes that economic development is not only transformative for the lower-income countries that are growing. Global development is in the national interest of all countries – including the United States. In the modern world, prosperity at home depends on prosperity abroad. Our development work helps mitigate risks to our own economic outlooks. And it helps drive our own economic growth by expanding global demand for our products and services. Simply put, our fates are interlinked.The United States’ approach to development is one of equal partnership. We are invested in the success of all developing countries at this Summit. We are committed to listening to the diverse needs and concerns of all nations. And we are here for the long haul. That’s why we make sure that economic assistance is effective, accountable, and sustainable – and reaches the communities it is intended to help.Importantly, the U.S. is deploying a wide-ranging set of tools to assist our partners. Our strategy mobilizes a broad suite of support – from supporting macroeconomic stability to mobilizing development financing to providing technical assistance. We are also working tirelessly to create a more resilient and thriving global economy, which benefits all countries.  Ahead of the Summit, I’d like to share three priorities that the United States is focused on: (1) evolving the multilateral development banks and expanding quality development financing, (2) promoting macroeconomic stability and debt sustainability, and (3) mobilizing public and private capital toward major challenges. We know change won’t come overnight. But our steady work will continue to improve the lives of people around the world. We hope that this Summit can serve as a key moment to spur more progress. First, we look forward to working with a growing number of partners to increase the effectiveness of development finance. In an interconnected world, the poorest and most vulnerable are often disproportionately harmed by global challenges – like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict. Any 21st century development strategy requires us to address these challenges with the scale and urgency they require.That’s why the United States has led a coalition of shareholders to evolve and invigorate the multilateral development banks. Our aim is to better combat these transboundary challenges in service of our poverty reduction and development goals. We have already achieved significant change in the eight months since I called for the evolution of these banks. We have made initial updates to the mission and operating model of the World Bank. And we have made preliminary reforms to the World Bank’s balance sheet – which will unlock as much as $50 billion in lending capacity over the next decade. As part of our agenda, the MDBs as a system could unlock $200 billion in new lending capacity over the same timeframe – through balance sheet measures that are either already under implementation or being deliberated. This financing can be used to reduce poverty, combat climate change, and advance other priorities. That is a big achievement in and of itself.In addition to our existing commitments, the United States is exploring ways to deliver new concessional World Bank financing. We strongly believe that our evolution initiative must benefit all borrowing countries. This new financing would incentivize action on global challenges and enhance support for low-income countries. This includes contributions for crisis support in IDA recipient countries. We invite other World Bank shareholders to join us in this effort in the lead-up to the September G20 Leaders’ Summit. Over the next two days, I also look forward to mobilizing additional support for the evolution initiative. As a next step, we would like the World Bank to develop a framework and principles for the targeted use of concessional resources – so that financing to address global challenges is deployed to where it has the highest impact. We believe the Bank should also develop a mechanism to allocate additional resources to countries seeking financing to tackle global challenges. We would also like to see the World Bank offer borrowers the option to add climate-resilient debt clauses to their loan agreements. These clauses will help ease pressures on countries if a natural disaster strikes. And lastly, we must make sure that the development banks and specialized trust funds work together as a system. This is particularly important in optimizing the many funds that constitute our climate finance architecture. We are taking a staged implementation approach to this initiative. So, we expect additional reforms to be implemented on a rolling basis. I am already working to sustain momentum for this initiative with the new World Bank President, Ajay Banga. He is the right leader for this moment.Second, we are working with our partners to strengthen macroeconomic stability. While there is no one formula for development, we know that no country can develop without a strong macroeconomic foundation. The IMF plays an important role in this effort. It provides countries with sound policy advice on macroeconomic reforms that should accompany greater financing. Recent innovations like the Resilience and Sustainability Trust and Food Shock Window demonstrate the IMF’s agility – and its effort to make sure that the Fund can meet countries’ needs while bringing its crucial macroeconomic policy support. I see great urgency in bringing the IMF’s concessional window, the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, to a more financially sustainable footing. This is critical to make sure lower-income countries have adequate resources at the Fund.   A key pillar of economic stability is debt sustainability. During my trip to Zambia earlier this year, I discussed how the weight of default and a stalled debt restructuring process can bring suffering to ordinary families and hold back the private investment that is needed to jump start the economy. Let me be clear: delaying debt treatment hurts both creditors and debtors. It simply worsens the economic fundamentals and increases the amount of debt relief that borrowers will eventually need. The international community must come together to support countries that are currently in crisis. This has been a top priority for me. I have pushed on this issue both in public and in private. At this Summit, the United States will continue to push for the full and speedy participation of all bilateral creditors in debt negotiations. I am encouraged by progress on Zambia and hope debt treatment can move forward soon. Other urgent pending cases must also move forward quickly. For example, I believe that all creditors for Ghana and Sri Lanka need to provide timely debt treatment in line with their financing assurances.More broadly, we will also redouble our commitment to improve the multilateral debt restructuring process. This includes our work through the Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable. Many creditors and debtors have been calling for more clarity on the Common Framework – and the debt restructuring process more generally. I believe that the publication of a guide for borrowers would be a productive first step. It would help address concerns about vagueness and uncertainty around the process.Third, we are targeting additional financing to specific challenges with the greatest need and impact. We have made significant progress across areas like public health, food security, climate change, and infrastructure. And we intend to do more. For example, the United States has contributed almost half a billion dollars to the Pandemic Fund to strengthen our global health architecture. And since last year, we have committed nearly $13.5 billion in humanitarian and development assistance to address the global food security crisis – along with other initiatives like our strategic partnership with the African Union on food security.Given the massive scale of our challenges, mobilizing private capital is integral to fully delivering solutions. That’s why we have leveraged the power of the private sector in a wide range of areas. Take climate. Last year, we launched a landmark Just Energy Transition Partnership between Indonesia and a group co-led by the United States. This Partnership will mobilize a historic initial $20 billion in financing to support ambitious new targets in Indonesia’s transition. Half of that $20 billion is coming from private sources. We are also negotiating the terms of a second concessional loan of more than $500 million to the Clean Technology Fund. This program mobilizes an average of over $3 in private co-finance for every dollar invested. On infrastructure, the G7 is channeling $600 billion into high-quality investments over the next few years as part of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The United States has pledged to mobilize $200 billion towards PGII. And we have achieved $30 billion of that commitment to date. A priority of our effort is to support project preparation. This helps expand the pipeline of bankable projects and lays the groundwork for private sector investment. To do just that, President Biden has requested $40 million in his Fiscal Year 2024 budget to expand the work of the Global Infrastructure Facility. We are particularly focused on identifying concrete ways to further scale private capital participation in emerging markets. There is significant opportunity to address information asymmetry through greater data sharing about viable investments. The multilateral development banks also need to build on their trusted relationships with governments to help them establish policy and regulatory frameworks that attract private investment. We also need to refine and increase the use of specific instruments like guarantees that can help de-risk projects.I’ve repeatedly called on the MDBs to massively increase their private capital mobilization rates. I am pleased that President Banga is making this a first priority in his leadership of the World Bank. And I know this approach is at the heart of President Goldfajn’s plan for IDB Invest 2.0. "

113,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here.

114,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

116,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
117,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

118,,"June 15, 2023","It’s great to be here with all of you. I want to thank our Coalition partners for their collaboration with us, including on this incredibly useful Guide. I am also grateful to my longtime friend, Lord Nicholas Stern, and the Grantham Institute for their work. Twenty-five years ago, I delivered my first speech warning about the dangers of climate change.In the years since then, we have seen extreme weather events accelerate with alarming severity and frequency. Droughts, floods, hurricanes, and other climate-related events have had devastating impacts on lives and livelihoods. Beyond the chronic impacts of climate change, acute weather-related supply shocks can destabilize regional economies.That’s why Treasury and the Biden Administration are pursuing important policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Examples include our Inflation Reduction Act clean energy investments, which will have positive spillovers across the world. They also include our Just Energy Transition Partnerships in our partner countries – along with our initiative to evolve the multilateral development banks to better address global challenges like the climate crisis. We are also considering ways to encourage private sector delivery of net-zero commitments and activities.But these policies are not self-executing. Today, I want to focus not on policy but on something more personal to all of us: my own experience running a finance ministry – and how I have evolved our institutional structure to deliver on our shared climate goals.First: building the capabilities and capacity to act. From my first day in office, our climate work has been a top priority. We reflected this urgency in a number of foundational documents – from Treasury’s Strategic Plan to a Climate Action Plan that we released about six months after I entered office. These plans laid out a comprehensive set of objectives for Treasury over the coming years – along with top-to-bottom actions that we would take to meet them.We also built the capacity to take on these additional responsibilities. We established a Climate Hub in the Department with a Climate Counselor who reports directly to me. This Hub is in charge of coordinating climate policy across all department offices. We also bolstered expert staff working on climate across our domestic and international affairs offices. We created a new leadership position on our economic analysis team dedicated to climate issues. And we established a new office to implement the landmark clean energy investments under the Inflation Reduction Act.We also urged our offices to improve the data and tools that they use to assess climate risks. For example, our Federal Insurance Office has proposed a data collection from certain property and casualty insurers. This proposed collection would help Treasury assess the potential for major disruptions of private insurance coverage in regions that are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.Second: we are creating the infrastructure to work with others. The U.S. Treasury has significant authorities to implement climate policies. But we cannot go at it alone. Meaningful climate action requires drawing on the best expertise.At Treasury, that means economists working with scientists and engineers – as well as tax lawyers and other experts. New processes and structures – like advisory committees – have helped us collaborate with others in our own government, as well as the private sector and other stakeholders. And of course, we have redoubled our work internationally and infused climate into all of our bilateral and multilateral engagements. This includes joining important groups – like this very Coalition, where we have benefited from best practices and lessons learned from all of you.Third: we must never forget that in addition to our responsibilities as finance ministers, we are also chief executives of large organizations. I lead around 100,000 dedicated public servants at Treasury and its bureaus. We have an opportunity to serve as a model for the rest of the nation and meet our respective government net-zero commitments. This means we must “walk the walk.” Treasury is reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout our operations and transitioning our fleet to electric vehicles. We all have a role to play in the climate transition.All across the world, we are seeing finance ministries take important institutional steps just like these. Every country confronts a unique set of circumstances. But we all share a common purpose: to mobilize action toward a net-zero world. The Coalition’s Guide is essential reading as each of us takes these significant strides."
119,,"June 13, 2023","Good afternoon, everyone. I want to first thank Edward and the U.S.-India Business Council for your partnership. You have served as an important partner for the Treasury Department over the past two and a half years. I am personally grateful in particular for your collaboration and support during my trips to India.I’m glad to join you to speak about our enhanced economic engagement with India – the result of a concerted effort by the Biden Administration to strengthen the partnership between our countries. By this fall, I will have traveled to India more times than any other country as Treasury Secretary – including four times in the span of less than a year. Today, I want to touch upon the significant progress that we’ve made during these visits to bolster our bilateral economic relations – as well as how our two nations have worked together to improve the global economy.First, we have made significant progress to strengthen our bilateral ties with India. The United States is India’s largest trading partner. In 2022, our bilateral trade reached over $190 billion. And we have significant cross-border investments and durable people-to-people ties as the two largest democracies in the world.Our Administration has taken concrete steps to build on this robust foundation. The first step has been enhancing our economic dialogue. The U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership has been a centerpiece of our formal economic dialogue since the Global Financial Crisis. We have moved the EFP meetings from an annual to a quarterly cadence. And I have personally met with Indian Finance Minister Sitharaman over ten times since assuming office. This reflects the importance of our close collaboration with India on issues spanning the macroeconomy to climate finance to financial regulation. We have also been close partners in responding to global disruptions and advancing our shared goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific. We are working closely with India, Australia, and Japan through the Quad. And we are writing new rules for the 21st century economy with India and a dozen other countries through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. Last month, IPEF member countries reached a first-of-its-kind international supply chains agreement under the Framework.Supply chain resilience has certainly been a major goal of our recent cooperation. After the shocks of recent years, the United States is pursuing a policy called “friendshoring” to deepen integration with our trusted trading partners. Our aim is to expand trade ties with the broad array of countries we can rely on – in order to create more redundancies in our critical supply chains. India is one of our reliable trading partners. Among other initiatives, we are working to connect new communities to the global market. And we are working to do so in a way that helps these communities move up the value chain.Looking forward, I believe that we have significant potential to grow trade and investment between our nations. Both of our countries are advancing what I call “modern supply-side” policies – investing in human capital, physical capital, and science and technology to boost our long-term economic potential. Prime Minister Modi has launched a massive infrastructure program – just as our country is beginning to see the early results of President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. India’s infrastructure investments have significant potential to boost productivity and increase the efficiency of trade between our two countries. Treasury is actively working with the Indian government to help them attract more private sector capital to close India’s infrastructure gap. Both of our countries are also pursuing leadership in clean energy technologies. Together, I believe our innovations can help push down the cost curves of new technologies and accelerate the world’s transition to a net-zero economy.Second, beyond our bilateral relationship, we are working closely with India during its G20 presidency on global economic issues. I believe that our close collaboration is showing the world how advanced and emerging economies can bridge policy differences and make progress on our shared policy objectives. When India and the United States work together, we can add significant momentum to important efforts.During the past six months, we have made progress across a number of areas. Debt distress in the developing world continues to pose a risk to macroeconomic growth and stability. Much more needs to be done to provide timely and comprehensive debt treatments. But we have taken steps forward on urgent cases like Sri Lanka – where India’s proactive actions have been critical to supporting the authorities’ reform efforts. We are continuing to push for urgent action in other cases as well.We’ve also made progress on our collective efforts to evolve the multilateral development banks to better address global challenges – like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict. And we are working together to shape the digital economy. We are collaborating with India to deliver tangible outcomes on the G20’s work to enhance cross-border payments – as well as our financial inclusion efforts to connect the unbanked around the world.There is much more to do. As you continue your work, know this: you have a strong and reliable partner in me and the U.S. Treasury Department. I look forward to supporting American businesses in India. And I appreciate you letting us know where we can provide greater certainty and guidance to facilitate economic and commercial activity between our two countries."
120,,"June 8, 2023","In the three months since the last TACRE meeting, we have taken meaningful steps forward. I want to highlight a few areas of work that are particularly notable.First, we continue to prioritize equitable implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act. As an example, last week, we released proposed rules for the law’s bonus credit for low-income communities. This program boosts the investment tax credit for solar and wind energy projects in underserved communities by up to 20 percentage points. It serves as a key feature to help ensure that all communities benefit from the growth of the clean energy economy. Last week’s release takes us one step closer to opening applications later this year.We are also making significant progress in creating a modern and fairer tax system that can better deliver for underserved communities. In April, the IRS finalized its new Strategic Operating Plan. The plan lays the foundation for a tax system that serves all taxpayers more fairly and equitably. Indeed, we know that tax benefits can play a critical role in supporting financial health and security. But every year, millions of Americans – including people of color and those in low-income and rural communities – miss out on taking advantage of credits and deductions for which they are eligible. We are committed to removing barriers to make it easier for all taxpayers to access their credits and deductions.This filing season, the IRS began to demonstrate what a difference resources can make for taxpayers. It answered two million more calls through live assistance. It cut phone wait times to four minutes from 27 minutes last year. And it served 100,000 more taxpayers in person. A team of translators has already published tax guides in 20 foreign languages, with more materials on the way. And we expect that all Taxpayer Assistance Centers nationwide will be fully staffed and open for additional hours next year so that working families can access in-person services. These efforts will help ensure that no community is left behind.I am very pleased that Congress has passed legislation to address the debt limit. Although the bipartisan agreement redirects some IRS funding to other areas of the federal budget, I want to assure you that the IRS has the resources it needs in the near term – to modernize customer service and improve enforcement among high earners and large corporations that are not paying the taxes they owe. We plan to continue to advocate for additional resources to make service improvements and help ensure that high-end taxpayers pay their fair share.Second, I would like to note that programs launched to aid our recovery from the pandemic continue to promote equity. Take the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program. This program has been a resounding success: it has made nearly 11 million payments to families at risk of eviction. And it has done so in a historically equitable manner. Large portions of the funds have gone to households of color, women-headed households, and extremely low-income renters.In April, Treasury awarded state and local grantees more than $520 million in reallocated funds to assist renters facing financial hardship. These funds may have otherwise gone unused in the ERA Program. We intentionally reallocated them to programs that have demonstrated particular success putting more funds into the hands of families facing urgent need. In total, we have reallocated nearly $5 billion of ERA funds. This has maximized the impact of this assistance for millions of families across the country. We have seen one of the strongest economic recoveries in modern history – in large part because of our American Rescue Plan and other efforts. Importantly, this recovery has been historically inclusive and broad-based. The Hispanic unemployment rate hit a record low last September, for instance. And the Black unemployment rate did the same earlier this year. While we saw an uptick in the rate in last week’s jobs report, there is significant volatility in each month’s report. The Black unemployment rate remains at one of its historically lowest levels.Third, I’m pleased to share that this week, we sent all Treasury bureaus and offices an explicit framework for promoting fair and equitable compliance and enforcement practices. Treasury is responsible for delivering key services, payments, and benefits to millions of Americans. And we are also responsible for enforcing rules and procedures to safeguard against waste, fraud, and abuse – and to make sure that obligations are being met. The framework is intended to ensure that our offices and bureaus go about this work in a way that promotes fairness, trust, and accountability. This includes addressing known disparities in audit rates. Bureaus and offices have been asked to review their existing policies, consult with relevant stakeholders, and regularly report back to us on their efforts. This initiative is part of our larger commitment to providing fair and impartial service that promotes public confidence in the critical work that we do.All of these efforts build on our existing work. For example, we continue to channel resources to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and Minority Depository Institutions. In April, we made the largest grant in the CDFI Fund’s history. We awarded more than $1.7 billion to more than 600 CDFIs. And we have been studying how our policies and programs are living up to our equity goals. In May, a team that included Treasury researchers published a report examining the receipt of Economic Impact Payments across demographic groups. I was pleased to see that these payments quickly and effectively reached underserved communities.As we continue our work, guidance from experts from a wide range of backgrounds is very valuable. That’s why this Committee and all of you in this room are so important. We are committed to supporting you in your efforts.I was pleased in April when you published cross-cutting principles to guide your work, along with priorities for the sub-committees. It is a testament to all of your devotion and hard work that you developed two recommendations related to data equity and research so quickly after the launch of this Committee. Please know that we deeply value your advice. I understand that our teams are already working to consider and follow up on the recommendations you have sent."
121,,"June 1, 2023","WASHINGTON- Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen issued the following statement after Congress passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act.  

“I am pleased that, under President Biden’s leadership, Congress has passed bipartisan legislation to suspend the debt limit and prevent a first-ever default by the United States. This legislation protects the full faith and credit of the United States and preserves our financial leadership, which is critical to our economic growth and stability.

A default would have caused severe hardship for American families, potentially leading to the loss of millions of jobs and trillions in household wealth, and higher financing costs for American taxpayers for years to come. The bipartisan agreement also protects against efforts to roll back the President’s core economic agenda – one that has contributed to a historically strong and resilient economic recovery. Congress has a duty to ensure that the United States can pay its bills on time, and I continue to strongly believe that the full faith and credit of the United States must never be used as a bargaining chip.

Now, our focus is to continue to deliver on the President’s economic agenda. Treasury will continue to effectively implement the Inflation Reduction Act, including the modernization of the IRS, to maximize economic benefits for American taxpayers, families, and workers.”

122,,"May 17, 2023","WASHINGTON – On May 17, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes Elizabeth Rosenberg hosted a roundtable with representatives of finance ministries from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom to discuss the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s recent strategy to address de-risking.As you all know, on April 25, the U.S. Treasury released a strategy to address de-Risking—the first such strategy released by the United States.  The strategy, mandated by Congress as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (or AMLA), includes a formal review of financial institution reporting requirements and advances recommendations to address the issue of de-risking. “De-risking” occurs when financial institutions terminate or restrict business relationships indiscriminately with broad categories of customers rather than analyzing and managing the risk of those customers. De-risking is therefore inconsistent with the risk-based approach that is the cornerstone of the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulatory framework for U.S. financial institutions, and global AML/CFT standards more broadly.Widespread access to well-regulated financial services facilitates financial inclusion, promotes competition, reduces the incentive to use unregistered financial services, and ensures that well-regulated financial systems remain central to international finance. These are all U.S. public policy goals.By contrast, de-risking can undermine several key U.S. government policy objectives, that you likely share in some form.  It drives financial activity out of the regulated financial system, hampers remittances, prevents low- and middle-income segments of the population from efficiently accessing the financial system, and prevents the transfer of humanitarian aid and disaster relief.  De-risking can also cause economic damage in strategically important regions by preventing individual remittances from flowing efficiently. It is a priority of the Biden-Harris Administration to shape a safer, more transparent, and more accessible financial system, while at the same time maintaining a robust framework to protect the U.S. financial system from illicit actors and bolstering national security. My message to you today is that it is therefore imperative that we address this complicated issue head-on and develop sound policy mechanisms to advance these core interests and limit harmful de-risking. The Treasury Strategy to Address De-risking is a key step in that direction.During the review that formed the basis for the strategy, Treasury conducted consultations over the last year with more than three dozen public- and private-sector stakeholders, including non-profit organizations (NPOs), financial institutions, and regulators.  This effort builds on the last decade of work by Treasury, in partnership with the federal banking agencies, to combat de-risking. The strategy analyzes the potential drivers of de-risking, finding that profitability is the primary factor in financial institutions’ de-risking decisions.  It notes, however, that profitability is influenced by a range of factors, such as a financial institutions’ available resources and the cost of implementing AML/CFT compliance measures and systems commensurate with the risk posed by a customer.  The strategy also assesses other factors, including reputational risk; risk appetite; a lack of clarity regarding regulatory expectations; and regulatory burdens, including compliance with sanctions regimes.Finally, the strategy offers a range of recommendations to address de-risking. Among the recommendations are promoting consistent regulatory expectations; providing better incentives to U.S. banks to avoid de-risking; and advancing forms of public and private engagement. Today’s event will give us an opportunity to discuss the issue of de-risking and our various strategies to address it in greater depth. Moreover, it is a valuable chance to bring together a key group of international partners who are like-minded and similarly situated with regard to de-risking. You represent a group of countries with large correspondent hub banks and remittance-sending diaspora communities. That means you all are in a prime position to observe the phenomenon of de-risking and its consequences, and to work with us to together address some of the vulnerabilities we see for countries and jurisdictions most severely affected by financial de-risking."
123,,"May 16, 2023","Good morning, everyone. It’s great to be back at ICBA. And it’s wonderful to see so many familiar faces. I’d like to first thank Derek and Rebeca for their leadership of this important organization.As some of you know, this is not my first time speaking at ICBA. One of my first major speeches as Chair of the Federal Reserve was at your 2014 Washington Policy Summit. Our nation has seen significant economic and technological change since then. But my conviction remains as firm as it was nearly a decade ago: that a broad and diverse banking system is at the core of a strong U.S. financial system. Our community banks are vital to the health of the American economy and the financial wellbeing of American families and businesses.Today, I’d like to share my views about the strength of our community banks, the recent developments in the regional banking system, and the debt limit situation.America’s community banks have always served as a cornerstone of many cities and towns across our country. But your role has proved even more important in recent years.Over the past two years, the United States has mounted a historic economic recovery from the pandemic. Take the labor market. The data is clear: our country is back to work. Over 12 million jobs have been created since President Biden took office. In 2020, our unemployment rate surged to nearly 15 percent as the world economy came to a standstill. It has now dropped to a historic 3.4 percent. That’s a more than 50-year low. This resurgence has been inclusive and broad-based. The Hispanic unemployment rate hit a record low last September. And the Black unemployment rate did the same earlier this year.But this historic economic progress was not preordained. It was made possible by the partnership between the federal government and many institutions in this room.Community banks served as a pillar of economic stability for their local communities during the pandemic. Large banks hold most of the assets in the banking sector. But smaller banks like yours have long played an outsized role in the provision of traditional financial services. As an example, community banks provide around 40 percent of small business loans. And they provide over 60 percent of farm loans. Strong client relationships and specialized knowledge of your communities enabled you to extend loans to American businesses under trying circumstances. These actions helped them stay open and expand. And your work helped us achieve a remarkable feat: many American households emerged from the pandemic in a stronger financial position than they were going into it.You take your responsibility to your communities very seriously. According to one survey, over a third of community banks reduced or eliminated late-payment penalties on loans or credit cards during the pandemic. And a similar percentage did the same for fees on deposit accounts.I’ve felt your impact firsthand through our relief efforts. In the middle of the pandemic, Treasury collaborated with banks across the country to deliver economic impact payments to millions of families. Our support helped Americans put food on the table and keep a roof over their heads. With your help, we deployed assistance to hundreds of thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure. And we worked together to deliver enhanced Child Tax Credit payments that helped cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021. We are continuing to partner to inject much-needed capital into underserved communities through programs like the State Small Business Credit Initiative and the Emergency Capital Investment Program. In the prior iteration of the Initiative, lenders with less than $10 billion in assets accounted for 95 percent of all program-supported loans. Your banks are playing an equally important role in our current program.As our nation has recovered, I’m pleased to say that the health and financial performance of our community banks have gotten stronger as well. In 2020, community banks – like all banks –reported pressures from the pandemic. Those pressures have largely been addressed over the past two years. Earnings have improved: community banks reported higher net income in 2022 than before the pandemic began. Loan growth has been strong and broad-based. And according to the latest reports from regulators, capital ratios remain robust. Asset quality is favorable. And community banks have ample liquidity to serve their customers. Their performance is a testament to the good management of many community banks across the country.In March, the federal government took forceful actions to strengthen public confidence in the banking system – following the failures of two large regional banks. The situation has stabilized since then. Aggregate deposit outflows have steadied. And the Fed’s Bank Term Funding Program and discount window are working as intended. Like our community banks, the U.S. banking system remains sound. There is strong liquidity and capital in the system.I believe that the decisive actions that we took in March to protect depositors and provide additional liquidity to the system mitigated the very serious risk of broader financial contagion in the banking system. Let me be clear: we did not take these steps to aid specific institutions or classes of institutions. These actions were necessary to prevent the difficulties facing two specific banks from spilling over to other banks – including banks on Main Streets across the country.Our actions in March were narrowly targeted. Management, shareholders, and debtholders were not protected by the government. Taxpayers did not bear any costs in the resolution of the two failed banks. And I believe that our actions reduced the risk of further bank failures that would have imposed losses on the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is paid for through fees on insured banks. To be sure, there have been some aftershocks of the March developments, including the resolution of First Republic. But I do not believe that these developments are a sign of any shift in the fundamental health of the banking system.We remain vigilant and continue to closely monitor conditions. As I’ve said, we have a set of effective tools at our disposal. We are prepared to take further actions if needed – including if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion. Americans should rest assured that their deposits are safe. Their deposits will be there when they need them.Looking forward, President Biden has said that we must make sure “we are not in this position again.” He has urged the federal banking agencies to consider a set of common-sense reforms that would strengthen the oversight of regional banks. President Biden and I are committed to do so while minimizing regulatory burden particularly on our nation’s smallest banks, which we know face unique challenges. Indeed, the President’s proposals would impose no additional regulations on traditional community banks.For example, the President has suggested exempting community banks from the costs of replenishing the Deposit Insurance Fund resulting from the two bank failures in March. Last week, the FDIC issued its proposal for a special assessment as required by law. I was encouraged that the proposed assessment would not apply to any banking organizations with $5 billion or less in uninsured deposits. In practice, this means that nearly all of the assessment would be paid by large banks.It’s important for me to use our remaining time to speak about one specific decision in front of Congress that will have significant implications for your businesses – and for the broader domestic and global economy.Yesterday, I told Congress that we still estimate that Treasury will likely no longer be able to satisfy all of the government’s obligations if Congress has not acted to address the debt limit by early June – and potentially as early as June 1. It is impossible to predict with certainty the exact date when Treasury will be unable to pay all of the government’s bills. And I will provide an additional update to Congress next week as more information becomes available.In my assessment – and that of economists across the board – a U.S. default would generate an economic and financial catastrophe. Over the past few years, American families and businesses – including many of yours – have worked hard to mount a historic economic recovery. A default would reverse all of the hard-earned progress that we’ve made. And it would set us back even further.Our economy would suddenly find itself in an unprecedented economic and financial storm. Millions of American families that rely on payments from the federal government would likely go unpaid. This ranges from 66 million Social Security beneficiaries to millions of veterans and military families who have served our country honorably. A default could cause widespread suffering as Americans lose the income that they need to get by. And the resulting income shock could lead to a recession that destroys many American jobs and businesses.The economic crisis would be exacerbated by possible disruptions to the federal government’s operations. Essential services that enable global commerce rely on the work of federal employees and contractors. That includes air traffic control and law enforcement, border security and national defense, and food safety and our telecommunications systems. But federal agencies would be unable to pay all of their bills. It is unclear if, and how, critical government services would continue to function.And of course, the financial crisis that accompanies a default on our debt could multiply the severity of the downturn. The U.S. Treasury market serves as the very bedrock of the global financial system. There’s a reason for that: the world has never doubted that America will pay the principal and interest on its bonds – in full and on time. That’s a fundamental principle of modern finance. A default would crack open the foundations upon which our financial system is built. It is very conceivable that we’d see a number of financial markets break – with worldwide panic triggering margin calls, runs, and fire sales.The White House Council of Economic Advisers has simulated the impact of a protracted default. It finds that it could lead to a downturn as severe as the Great Recession. In its simulation, over 8 million Americans lose their jobs. Business and consumer confidence take a substantial hit. The value of the stock market is slashed by about 45 percent – wiping out years of retirement and other household savings. Moody’s Analytics used a different model to project the effects of a default. But it reached a similar conclusion. In its study, more than 7 million Americans lose their jobs. The unemployment rate surges to over 8 percent. And $10 trillion in household wealth is wiped out.Now, this crisis is entirely preventable. The solution is simple. Since 1960, Congress has raised or suspended the debt limit about 80 times – under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Congress should simply do so again. Raising or suspending the debt limit does not authorize new federal spending. It simply allows the government to make good on its existing commitments. Let me be clear: if Congress does not address the debt limit, there are no good options that Treasury or the government can use to save us from catastrophe.We are a country that keeps its word. Generations of Americans have protected the full faith and credit of the United States. That has been a bedrock of our global economic leadership. There is no good reason to squander that reputation now – and to trigger a manufactured crisis of our own creation.Time is running out. Every single day that Congress does not act, we are experiencing increased economic costs that could slow down the U.S. economy. In 2011, we resolved the debt ceiling crisis right before the government had to stop making payments. But that eleventh-hour brinksmanship led to the first-ever downgrade of our credit rating in history. Consumer confidence fell by over 20 percent. The S&P 500 plummeted by about 17 percent. Spreads for mortgages and auto loans widened, which generally makes it harder for households to afford houses and cars.We are already seeing the impacts of brinksmanship: investors have become more reluctant to hold government debt that matures in early June. And the impasse has already increased the debt burden to American taxpayers – as the leaders of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee said last week.Too many businesses – including yours – are having to spend your time planning around the potential risk of U.S. default, instead of thinking about longer-term investments that will grow your enterprises and boost the economy. And too many households are having to worry about how they will get by without the payments that the government has promised them – and that these American families have earned.The U.S. economy hangs in the balance. The livelihoods of millions of Americans do too. There is no time to waste. Congress should address the debt limit as soon as possible.To close, I’d like to return to where I began. The economic progress that we have made over the past two years has been premised on the fact that communities are able to access the credit they need. Community banks have been at the forefront of this effort – as they have been for decades."

Minister Suzuki, it is great to see you again after our meetings at the IMF and World Bank last month. And it is a pleasure to be back in Japan. Thank you for your hospitality.

I am pleased to meet with you during the G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting in Niigata.

We are grateful to Japan for your leadership during this G7 host year. This year, the G7 has demonstrated a steadfast unity in our response to Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine. And our work together on critical macroeconomic issues is contributing to a stronger global economy.

I appreciate your focus as G7 host on highlighting supply chain resilience and clean energy technologies. Spillovers from Russia’s war against Ukraine and disruptions caused by the pandemic have made clear the importance of diversified and resilient supply chains.

I look forward to discussing global economic developments with you. At the G7 and beyond, we need to address pressing issues around the world, such as debt vulnerabilities in emerging market and developing economies and evolving the multilateral development banks.

I am deeply proud of the strong relationship between the United States and Japan, which is based on trust, respect, and deep ties.

The U.S.-Japan Alliance is a pillar of global stability and of our shared commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. I look forward to continuing to build on the strong foundation of our relationship as we discuss new areas of bilateral and multilateral cooperation."

Chancellor Hunt, I want to thank you for meeting with me and for your strong partnership on some of the most pressing challenges facing the global economy.

Today, Chancellor Hunt and I will discuss several shared objectives.

First, we will discuss our coalition’s response to Russia’s brutal and illegal war against Ukraine. One year ago at the G7 Finance Ministers meeting, we collectively had our first conversations about the G7 price cap. Today, there is already clear evidence that it is achieving our goals of hurting Russia's ability to prosecute its illegal war and helping the global economy.

Looking ahead, we are redoubling our efforts to choke off sanctions evasion and combat Russian military procurement in key jurisdictions. Our teams are traveling around the world and conducting joint engagements to identify and disrupt evasion networks. Russia's increasing reliance on these channels is a sign of its growing desperation.

We will also discuss support for Ukraine’s economy. As President Biden has said, the United States will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. The United Kingdom is a close partner of ours in this effort.

Second, we will discuss reforms to evolve the multilateral development banks to better meet the challenges we face in an interconnected world, like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict.

These challenges disproportionately impact the poorest and most vulnerable, and better addressing them is vital to boosting resilience and enabling progress on poverty reduction and inclusive and sustainable growth.

Third, we will discuss ways to strengthen the global economy and engage with lower-income countries. I appreciate Chancellor Hunt’s partnership in bolstering our economic security and resilience and supporting low- and middle-income countries, which can become critical parts of a robust global supply chain.

We will also continue our work together to address debt challenges faced by many lower and middle-income countries, lower global energy prices while meeting our climate commitments, and diversify our supply chains in critical sectors."
126,,"May 11, 2023","It is a pleasure to see you, Minister Haddad. We had a good conversation when you accompanied President Lula to the White House in February, and I am looking forward to building on our relationship today.We share a common bond as representatives from the two largest democracies in the Americas. We stand united in upholding our democratic values both at home and abroad.We are excited to have you joining the G7 at these meetings. We must all partner together to address the global challenges we face today, and Brazil’s role in those global efforts will be critical in its G20 Presidency next year. We look forward to supporting your leadership next year.We share common goals in areas such as combatting climate change, building high-quality infrastructure, mobilizing private capital for development, and helping support countries combat poverty through strengthened multilateral institutions.At a time of heightened uncertainty and risks, we must work together to show developing countries that the G20 can provide practical, actionable solutions.The United States is working with Brazil and other nations to increase the quantity and quality of climate financing at the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, including for adaptation and resilience.The Biden-Harris Administration recently announced its intent to contribute $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund and $500 million to Brazil’s Amazon Fund.And as both friends and important trading partners, we seek to deepen our economic relationship. To this end, our nations are advancing our partnership on several fronts.For example, Treasury is actively working with Brazilian authorities to develop effective public-private partnerships and long-term finance through capital markets.Treasury is also spearheading climate finance cooperation, including through the Amazon Fund, the Global Environment Facility, Climate Investment Funds, and the Green Climate Fund."
127,,"May 11, 2023","Earlier this month, I told the U.S. Congress that our best estimate is that the United States government will be unable to continue to satisfy all of its obligations by early June – and potentially as early as June 1 – if Congress does not address the debt limit before that time. That projection underscores the urgent need for Congress to act as soon as possible.In my assessment – and that of economists across the board – a default on U.S. obligations would produce an economic and financial catastrophe. Millions of Americans could lose their jobs. Household incomes would be reduced. American businesses would see credit markets deteriorate. And millions of American families that receive government payments would likely be left without the resources that they were promised. This would make it dramatically harder for households to spend and businesses to invest. A default would threaten the gains that we’ve worked so hard to make over the past few years in our pandemic recovery. And it would spark a global downturn that would set us back much further. It would also risk undermining U.S. global economic leadership and raise questions about our ability to defend our national security interests.Short of a default, brinksmanship over the debt limit can also impose serious economic costs. We know this from recent history. As we learned in 2011, just the serious threat of default can lead to a downgrade of our credit rating and a weakening of consumer confidence. We could see a rise in interest rates drive up payments on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. We are already seeing spikes in interest rates for debt due around the date that the debt limit may bind.   There is no good reason to generate a crisis of our own making. The U.S. Congress has raised or suspended the debt limit about 80 times since 1960. I urge it to act quickly to do so once again.  Let me now turn to our work at the G7. I’d first like to thank Finance Minister Suzuki and his team for hosting the G7 Ministerial. And thank you to Japan for its leadership of our group this year.There are many issues that we will work on this week. But today, I would like to highlight three of my core priorities. The first is the global macroeconomy. We are taking a broad range of individual and joint actions to bring down inflation, sustain growth, and help mitigate the impact of external shocks, including to developing countries. The second is to redouble our commitment to support Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia. And the third is our longer-term work to bolster economic resilience and security. As we advance these priorities, I look forward to working not only with my colleagues from the G7 – but those from several non-G7 partners that are here this week, including developing countries and emerging markets. We all have shared goals. I look forward to productive discussions about how we can better deliver for all.First, even as we face downside risks, I believe that the global economy remains in a better place than many predicted six months ago. In most G7 countries – including the United States – annual headline inflation has fallen in recent months. And the growth outlook for the global economy is better than it was in the fall. In the United States, we have taken decisive action to tackle elevated inflation and strengthen confidence in the banking system, while also enacting a trifecta of historic legislation to raise our long-term growth potential. Other countries have taken actions to address their near-term challenges as well. We encourage our partners to make long-term investments in their productivity and in combating climate change. When we strengthen our own economies, we strengthen the global economy as well.But we need to do more. It’s important that we take concerted actions to improve the economic outlook for the entire world – particularly in developing countries. That’s why we will coordinate on our efforts to push hard for timely and comprehensive debt treatments for countries in debt distress. And it’s why we have worked hard to take joint actions to lower food and energy costs during a volatile period. Many of these actions have had the largest impact on the poorest countries.Of course, we remain attuned to economic headwinds and downside risks. The world was still recovering from the pandemic when Russia began its illegal full-scale war against Ukraine. These shocks continue to impose significant costs on the global economy. Further, markets are seeing the possibility of a U.S. debt limit breach as a growing downside risk.Second, I look forward to coordinating with other G7 members to support Ukraine and degrade Russia’s ability to wage war. When the G7 finance ministers gathered together last spring, Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine was less than three months old. Now, the war is approaching its 450th day. Since Day One, our countries have stood united to support the Ukrainian people as they have mounted a fierce resistance.The United States is proud to have provided significant economic, security, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. And we are just as proud to be part of a broad coalition that has stepped up to assist Ukraine in its moment of need. We are pleased that the IMF’s program for Ukraine will provide critical financing for the country while putting it on a path of macroeconomic stabilization and future recovery. The program will bolster President Zelenskyy’s commitment to accountability and good governance. And it will help Ukraine’s economic officials provide a steady hand for its economy and reform agenda in the coming months and years.We are also continuing to lead a multilateral coalition of over 30 countries to impose heavy economic costs on Russia for its war. Over the past year, our campaign has systematically degraded Russia’s military-industrial complex and helped reduce the revenues that Russia can use to fund its war. Because these sanctions are having an impact, Russia is trying to get around them. This year, a central piece of our strategy is to take further actions to disrupt Russia’s attempts to evade our sanctions. Our three-pronged approach involves improving information sharing and coordination among our allies and partners; putting pressure on companies and jurisdictions that we know are allowing or facilitating evasion; and identifying and shutting down specific channels used by Russia to equip and fund its military. We have taken a wave of actions in the past few months to crack down on evasion. And my team has traveled around the world to intensify this work.Our innovative policies to support Ukraine extend to our joint efforts to restrict Russian oil export revenues. Last May, the G7 finance ministers discussed the price cap policy for the first time. Our goals were two-fold: to reduce revenues for the Kremlin while helping stabilize global energy markets. A few months into its implementation, we see clear signs that the price cap is working. The Russian government’s oil revenues from January through March of this year were over 40 percent lower than a year prior. And importantly, global oil markets have remained relatively stable since the imposition of the crude oil cap last December. In short, the price cap has helped stabilize the global economy just as it has hurt Russia’s ability to wage its illegal war. Members of the price cap coalition are committed to prohibiting or phasing out imports of Russian oil. But we continue to urge developing countries to save on their oil costs by taking advantage of the price cap to negotiate steep bargains on Russian oil.Third, I will work with my counterparts on our longer-term initiative to build greater economic resilience and bolster economic security. Our goal is not only to enhance resilience for ourselves. It is also to build resilience for our allies and partners – including developing countries around the world.We are advancing important work to build reliable and secure critical supply chains. This is part of an effort that I have called “friendshoring.” We also believe that our supply-chain diversification efforts can open up more trade and investment opportunities for developing countries that have traditionally only had limited footprints in global supply chains. During the upcoming G7 meetings, I am looking forward to discussing ways to partner with developing countries to help them better integrate into global trade – in a way that moves countries away from solely extractive industries into activities that provide greater support for the domestic economy and employment. This work will build on the investments already underway through the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. Our partnership is already helping bolster global supply chains by mobilizing private capital toward infrastructure projects in developing countries. We also look forward to building on our work with about a dozen countries through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework that was launched this time last year in Japan.The G7 will also advance our work to mitigate geostrategic risks in our economies. As I said in a speech last month, the United States has a broad suite of tools to mitigate risks to our national security. And we will take narrowly targeted actions when necessary. We are looking forward to working with the G7 to effectively counter economic coercion, which is a key focus of Japan’s presidency.We also know that many of the threats to economic resilience are coming from the global challenges that we all face. Since last fall, the United States has worked with shareholders to evolve the multilateral development banks to better combat 21st century global challenges. Transboundary challenges like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict are disproportionately impacting the most vulnerable among us. We are accelerating the momentum for our evolution initiative and aim to adopt a rolling set of World Bank reforms over the coming months. These G7 meetings present us with an opportunity to coordinate our collaboration with and support for lower-income countries."

This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
130,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
131,,"November 21, 2023",
132,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
133,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1. For additional analysis on Treasury market liquidity conditions, see (for example): “Resilience redux in the Treasury Market” by Darrell Duffie (August 25, 2023) and “How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Evolved in 2023” by Michael Fleming (October 17, 2023).2. Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

134,,"May 3, 2023","“I warmly congratulate Ajay Banga on his election to lead the World Bank. Ajay Banga will bring to this important role the right leadership and management skills, experience living and working in emerging markets, and financial expertise to lead the World Bank at a critical moment in its history.  Ajay understands that the challenges we face – from combatting climate change, pandemics, and fragility to eliminating extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity – are deeply intertwined. He has effectively built a broad global coalition around his vision for the Bank over the course of his candidacy.

Right now, we are undertaking a vital effort to evolve the World Bank and other multilateral development banks to redouble their work on global challenges like climate change in a way that accelerates progress on national development priorities. Six months after my call to action during the Annual Meetings, we made an important down payment on that effort last month. The reforms adopted will sharpen the Bank’s mission, align its operations with our new goals, and help unlock as much as $50 billion in lending capacity over the coming decade to combat extreme poverty, boost economic growth, and build resilience to global challenges. 

Our ambitious goals will not be met overnight, and we remain committed to a staged adoption of reforms over the course of the year to build on the vision we have laid out. Ajay Banga will play a critical role in that work, including its development and implementation in the coming years. His track record of forging partnerships between the public sector, private sector, and non-profits uniquely equips him to help mobilize private capital and press for the reforms needed to meet our shared ambitions. In doing so, the World Bank can serve as a force multiplier for good by setting the right agenda and catalyzing action from across the spectrum.

I also thank President Malpass and the staff of the World Bank for their tireless work, including in advancing the evolution agenda to date and confronting immense global challenges  like the pandemic, Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine, and rising debt vulnerabilities.

I look forward to partnering closely with Ajay Banga and the Bank on the important work ahead of us.”"
135,,"April 25, 2023","Good morning, everyone. It’s great to be with you at the 51st annual “Cap-to-Cap” program. I’m thankful that over four hundred of you have made the trip to Washington. I’d like to extend a special welcome to the more than a hundred here who are members of this delegation for the first time.I’d also like to thank my longtime friend, Congresswoman Matsui, for her invitation to speak to you today. Doris, you have been an ardent champion for Californians throughout your life. And I believe that your efforts have been instrumental in delivering on our Administration’s economic agenda. This has been particularly true with your leadership in shaping and passing the CHIPS and Science Act. Thank you for everything.Today, I will focus on what we have done and can continue to do together to position the United States for economic success. Over the past two years, Treasury has worked with local leaders – including many here – to help drive a historically strong economic recovery. I’ll speak about the progress that we’ve made to bring our economy back from the depths of the COVID pandemic.Then, I’ll turn to the future and speak to the Biden Administration’s suite of historic long-term economic investments: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act. My focus will be on the Inflation Reduction Act, which Treasury is playing a leading role in implementing. This law is not only the boldest climate action in our nation’s history. It also serves as a major set of economic programs – one that is already leading to new cutting-edge projects and high-quality jobs across America.When the President took office in 2021, our country was in the depths of the pandemic. About 400,000 Americans had died from COVID. And about 3,000 additional lives were being lost each day. The public health calamity had triggered an economic one. In January 2021, about 800,000 Americans were filing jobless claims each week. That was higher than in the worst moments of the Great Recession.So, the President acted decisively. Working with many of you, our Administration launched a vaccination campaign to put shots in arms. And we provided immediate relief to households, businesses, and state and local governments through the American Rescue Plan.Our plan worked. The past two years have seen a historic recovery. Nearly 13 million jobs have been created since the beginning of 2021. We’ve seen the fastest two years of business formation on record. Importantly, our recovery has been historically equitable. For example, last month, the Black unemployment rate reached a record low of 5 percent. That’s from a pandemic high of almost 17 percent. The Sacramento area alone has added nearly 100,000 jobs since the start of 2021. This strong growth is consistent with the nation’s as a whole.It’s important to emphasize this: our economic recovery has been a collective effort. It was made possible through our close partnership with thousands of local and state governments, unions, businesses, and non-profits – including many in this room.Through the Rescue Plan’s state and local program, we worked closely with many of these stakeholders to support over 30,000 governments to maintain vital public services for their residents. The City and County of Sacramento have used these funds to support urgent priorities like COVID mitigation and workforce training for underserved youth. Treasury has also worked with state governments and the private sector to inject capital into small businesses and underserved communities – while also collaborating with authorities like the Sacramento Housing and Redevelopment Agency to help families at risk of eviction.Of course, our work is not yet finished. We still face near-term challenges. Our Administration’s top economic priority is to tackle inflation while protecting the economic gains of the past two years. While inflation is still elevated, annual price growth has fallen by nearly four percentage points since its summer peak. Our Administration remains committed to taking bold actions to mitigate the pain of higher prices. These actions include continuing to ease supply chain pressures; stabilizing global energy markets; and providing relief for everyday costs like healthcare premiums and prescription drugs.As our economy transitions to steady growth, we are also making historic investments in its long-term strength. Over the past year and a half, we have enacted our generation’s most ambitious investment in infrastructure; led a major expansion of American advanced manufacturing; and passed the boldest climate action in our nation’s history.The climate crisis is an existential challenge. And it is not just tomorrow’s issue. The impacts of global warming are already being felt across our communities today – particularly those that are most vulnerable to its effects. In the United States, there’s been at least a five-fold increase in the annual number of billion-dollar natural disasters in the past five years as compared to the 1980s – even after adjusting for inflation. You know this well: in California, wildfires have been a longstanding challenge. But the threat of these wildfires has grown dramatically in recent years.The President has called the 2020s “the decisive decade” to address climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act puts us on a strong course to achieve our climate goals. And together with actions taken by other nations, this law can help mitigate the worst consequences of global warming on our planet.But the impact of this law extends far beyond the climate. The Inflation Reduction Act presents a generational economic opportunity for American workers and businesses: to establish and extend our country’s economic leadership in key clean energy technologies and industries.A cornerstone of the Administration’s approach is to harness the power of the private sector. Specifically, we believe that government must provide the basic foundations and certainty that businesses need to invest at scale and drive the clean energy transition.The Inflation Reduction Act offers significant tax credits to do just that. Before the law, investors lacked long-term certainty because these credits were available for only a few years and subject to Congressional renewal at short intervals. There was also little, if any, support for new technologies that could help transition harder-to-abate sectors – such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. The Inflation Reduction Act expands and extends the suite of clean energy tax credits. The law is providing greater long-term certainty for businesses on their returns on investment. And it will jumpstart innovation and growth in a broad range of emerging technologies – while also sustaining and accelerating our progress on more established ones.We’re already seeing a significant mobilization of private investment into the clean energy sector. The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law just over eight months ago. Since then, firms up and down the supply chain have announced tens of billions of dollars in projects that will create thousands of high-quality, good-paying American jobs. One analysis indicates that 2022 was a record year for EV battery manufacturing in particular. Last year alone, more than $73 billion in planned projects were announced. Sacramento has been a leader on climate policy, and we look forward to seeing businesses in the area take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives.But successful implementation of this law does not only rest on engagement from businesses. For the first time, non-profits and local, Tribal, and other governmental entities will be able to benefit directly from these tax credits. This tax law innovation – along with others – will expand financing for projects and boost the reach of this law.In the coming months, Treasury will continue to provide clarity and certainty through our timely guidance. We will engage with stakeholders like you on our policy choices. But we know it’s not enough to design good policies. We must put those policies into action. So, the IRS is conducting significant outreach to help stakeholders understand the eligibility and technical requirements for these credits and deductions. And it is developing digital processes that will make it easier for eligible taxpayers to claim them.Now, I wish I could continue to speak about our historic investments in the American economy. But I need to use my remaining time to address an issue that could threaten all the progress that we’ve made over the past two years.As many of you know, I have asked Congress to raise or suspend the debt limit. Since 1789, the United States has paid all of our bills on time. It should stay that way. In my assessment – and that of economists across the board – a default on our debt would produce an economic and financial catastrophe. Many residents in Sacramento could ultimately lose their jobs. Household payments on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards would rise. And American businesses would see credit markets deteriorate. On top of that, it is unlikely that the federal government would be able to issue payments to millions of Americans, including our military families and seniors who rely on Social Security. In the longer term, a default would raise the cost of borrowing into perpetuity. Future investments would become substantially more costly.This economic catastrophe is preventable. The solution is simple: Congress must vote to raise or suspend the debt limit. It should do so without conditions. And it should not wait until the last minute. I believe it is a basic responsibility of our nation’s leaders to get this done.Over the past two years, we have worked together to rescue the economy from a once-in-a-century pandemic crisis. I look forward to working with you not only on our immediate challenges – but to build on our progress and strengthen our long-term economic outlook in the years to come."
136,,"April 20, 2023","WASHINGTON, DC - Today, at the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, President Joe Biden announced $1 billion in U.S. funding to the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the world’s largest climate and environment focused multilateral fund. The $1 billion doubles the total funding provided from the United States to the GCF, of which half is expected to support adaptation-related projects and the President's Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience (PREPARE). The funding underscores Treasury’s commitment to support countries to adapt to the impacts of a changing climate, improve energy and food security, build resilience, and protect critical ecosystems, such as forests, and biodiversity. Secretary Yellen applauded the announcement, saying, “The United States’ $1 billion in funding to the GCF will mobilize billions in additional public and private finance for investment in climate adaptation and emissions mitigation. This funding provides critical concessional finance to support developing countries’ transition to resilient and sustainable economies and enhance their energy security.” The GCF partners with over 200 entities, including private sector financial institutions, multilateral and national public development banks, and civil society organizations, to finance a portfolio of impactful climate and environmental projects in 128 developing countries. Through its investments, the GCF catalyzes additional sources of finance for adaptation, mitigation, and resilience-focused projects and prioritizes funding for the most vulnerable countries, notably small island developing states, least developed countries, and African states. To date, GCF’s approximately $12 billion in financing has mobilized an additional $33 billion in public and private co-financing. U.S. institutions, including impact investors and nonprofits, are among the GCF’s network of implementing partners. Several are currently partnering with GCF on projects that are under implementation.  In addition to supporting developing countries’ climate strategies, the U.S. contribution will also help to create growth and investment opportunities in developing markets for U.S. businesses."
137,,"April 20, 2023","Good morning, everyone. Dean Steinberg, thank you for your kind introduction. And thank you for your service to our country. I’m grateful for your contributions – not only during your time in government but here at SAIS.I’m particularly glad to be at this institution. SAIS has one of the oldest and most extensive China studies programs in the country. In 1979, the United States established full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China. Just two years after, your university leaders had their own talks with their Chinese counterparts. The goal was to see whether Johns Hopkins and Nanjing University could partner together to educate future leaders.The result: the establishment of the Hopkins-Nanjing Center in 1986 – one of the first Western academic programs in modern China. This collaboration has been tested by the realities and complexities of our bilateral relationship. But I believe the students on this campus have served as a reminder of the respect that the American and Chinese people have for each other. And they demonstrate that people around the world can learn from one another if we communicate openly and honestly – even and especially when we disagree.Since I began my career, the relationship between the United States and China has undergone a significant evolution. In the 1970s, our relationship was defined by rapprochement and gradual normalization. I watched President Nixon make his famous journey to China in 1972. And I heard our two countries begin to speak to each other again after decades of silence. In the years that followed, I saw China choose to implement market reforms and open itself to the global economy, driving an impressive rise into the second-largest economy in the world. Its development was supported by assistance from the World Bank and other international economic institutions. And the U.S. Congress and successive administrations played a major role in supporting China’s integration into global markets.But in recent years, I’ve also seen China’s decision to pivot away from market reforms toward a more state-driven approach that has undercut its neighbors and countries across the world. This has come as China is striking a more confrontational posture toward the United States and our allies and partners – not only in the Indo-Pacific but also in Europe and other regions.Today, we are at a critical time. The world is confronting the largest land war in Europe since World War II – just as it recovers from a once-in-a-century pandemic. Debt challenges are mounting for low- and middle-income countries. Some nations, including our own, have faced pressures on their economic and financial systems. And a U.N. report released last month indicates that the Earth is likely to cross a critical global warming threshold within the next decade – if no drastic action is taken.Progress on these issues requires constructive engagement between the world’s two largest economies. Yet our relationship is clearly at a tense moment.So today, I would like to discuss our economic relationship with China. My goal is to be clear and honest: to cut through the noise and speak to this essential relationship based on sober realities. The United States proceeds with confidence in its long-term economic strength. We remain the largest and most dynamic economy in the world. We also remain firm in our conviction to defend our values and national security. Within that context, we seek a constructive and fair economic relationship with China. Both countries need to be able to frankly discuss difficult issues. And we should work together, when possible, for the benefit of our countries and the world.First, we will secure our national security interests and those of our allies and partners, and we will protect human rights. We will clearly communicate to the PRC our concerns about its behavior. And we will not hesitate to defend our vital interests. Even as our targeted actions may have economic impacts, they are motivated solely by our concerns about our security and values. Our goal is not to use these tools to gain competitive economic advantage.Second, we seek a healthy economic relationship with China: one that fosters growth and innovation in both countries. A growing China that plays by international rules is good for the United States and the world. Both countries can benefit from healthy competition in the economic sphere. But healthy economic competition – where both sides benefit – is only sustainable if that competition is fair. We will continue to partner with our allies to respond to China’s unfair economic practices. And we will continue to make critical investments at home – while engaging with the world to advance our vision for an open, fair, and rules-based global economic order.Third, we seek cooperation on the urgent global challenges of our day. Since last year’s meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi, both countries have agreed to enhance communication around the macroeconomy and cooperation on issues like climate and debt distress. But more needs to be done. We call on China to follow through on its promise to work with us on these issues – not as a favor to us, but out of our joint duty and obligation to the world. Tackling these issues together will also advance the national interests of both of our countries.In recent years, many have seen conflict between the United States and China as increasingly inevitable. This was driven by fears, shared by some Americans, that the United States was in decline. And that China would imminently leapfrog us as the world’s top economic power – leading to a clash between nations.It’s important to know this: pronouncements of U.S. decline have been around for decades. But they have always been proven wrong. The United States has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to adapt and reinvent to face new challenges. This time will be no different – and the economic statistics show why.Since the end of the Cold War, the American economy has grown faster than most other advanced economies. And over the past two years, we have mounted the strongest post-pandemic recovery among major advanced economies. Our unemployment rate is near historic lows. Real GDP per capita has reached an all-time high, and we have experienced the strongest two-year growth in new businesses on record.This recovery is made possible by the strength of our economic fundamentals. Of course, this does not mean that our work is finished. Our top economic priority is to rein in inflation while protecting the economic gains of our recovery. A few weeks ago, the United States took decisive action to strengthen public confidence in the banking system after the failures of two regional institutions. The U.S. banking system remains sound, and we will take any necessary steps to ensure the United States continues to have the strongest and safest financial system in the world.Over the past few decades, China has experienced an impressive economic rise. Between 1980 and 2010, China’s economy grew by an average of 10 percent per year. This led to a truly remarkable feat: the rise of hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. China’s rapid catch-up growth was fueled by its opening-up to global trade and pursuit of market reforms. But like many countries, China today faces its share of near-term headwinds. This includes vulnerabilities in its property sector, high youth unemployment, and weak household consumption. In the longer term, China faces structural challenges. Its population is aging, and its workforce is already declining. And it has experienced a sharp reduction in productivity growth – amid its turn toward economic nationalism and policies that substantially increase the government’s intervention in the economy. None of these recent developments detract from China’s progress or the hard work and talent of the Chinese people. But China’s long-run growth rate seems likely to decline. Of course, an economy’s size is not the sole determinant of its strength. America is the largest economy in the world, but it also remains an unparalleled leader on a broad set of economic metrics – from wealth to technological innovation. U.S. GDP per capita is among the highest in the world and over five times as large as China’s. More than resources or geography, our country’s success can be attributed to our people, values, and institutions. American democracy, while not perfect, protects the free exchange of ideas and rule of law that is at the bedrock of sustainable growth. Our educational and scientific institutions lead the world. Our innovative culture is enriched by new immigrants, including those from China – enabling us to continue to generate world-class, cutting-edge products and industries.Importantly, our economic power is amplified because we don’t stand alone. America values our close friends and partners in every region of the world, including the Indo-Pacific. In the 21st century, no country in isolation can create a strong and sustainable economy for its people. That’s why, under President Biden’s leadership, we’ve sought to rebuild and reinvest in our relationships with other countries.All this to say: China’s economic growth need not be incompatible with U.S. economic leadership. The United States remains the most dynamic and prosperous economy in the world. We have no reason to fear healthy economic competition with any country.There are many challenges before us. But the President and I believe that China and the United States can manage our economic relationship responsibly. We can work toward a future in which both countries share in and drive global economic progress. Whether we can reach this vision depends in large part on what both countries do in the next few years.As in all of our foreign relations, national security is of paramount importance in our relationship with China. For example, we have made clear that safeguarding certain technologies from the PRC’s military and security apparatus is of vital national interest.We have a broad suite of tools to achieve this aim. When necessary, we will take narrowly targeted actions. The U.S. government’s actions can come in the form of export controls. They can include additions to an entity list that restricts access by those that provide support to the People’s Liberation Army. The Treasury Department has sanctions authorities to address threats related to cybersecurity and China’s military-civil fusion. We also carefully review foreign investments in the United States for national security risks and take necessary actions to address any such risks. And we are considering a program to restrict certain U.S. outbound investments in specific sensitive technologies with significant national security implications.As we take these actions, let me be clear: these national security actions are not designed for us to gain a competitive economic advantage, or stifle China’s economic and technological modernization. Even though these policies may have economic impacts, they are driven by straightforward national security considerations. We will not compromise on these concerns, even when they force trade-offs with our economic interests.First, these actions will be narrowly scoped and targeted to clear objectives. They will be calibrated to mitigate spillovers into other areas. Second, it is vital that these tools are easily understood and enforceable. And they must be readily adaptable when circumstances change. Third, when possible, we will engage and coordinate with our allies and partners in the design and execution of our policies.In addition, communication is essential to mitigating the risk of misunderstanding and unintended escalation. When we take national security actions, we will continue to outline our policy reasoning to other countries. We will listen and address concerns about unintended consequences.Among our most pressing national security concerns is Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine. In my visit to Kyiv, I saw firsthand the brutality of Russia’s invasion. The Kremlin has bombed hospitals; destroyed cultural sites; attacked energy grids to cause widespread pain and suffering among civilians. Ending Russia’s war is a moral imperative. It will save many innocent lives. As I’ve said, it is also the single best thing we can do for the global economy. To help end Russia’s war, we have mounted the swiftest, most unified, and most ambitious multilateral sanctions regime in modern history. Our broad coalition of partners has also provided assistance to Ukraine so it can defend itself.China’s “no limits” partnership and support for Russia is a worrisome indication that it is not serious about ending the war. It is essential that China and other countries do not provide Russia with material support or assistance with sanctions evasion. We will continue to make the position of the United States extremely clear to Beijing and companies in its jurisdiction. The consequences of any violations would be severe.With our own eyes, the world has seen the PRC government escalate its repression at home. It has deployed technology to surveil and control the Chinese people – technology that it is now exporting to dozens of countries.Human rights abuses violate the world’s moral conscience. They also violate the foundational principles of the United Nations – which virtually every country, including China, has signed onto. The United States will continue to use our tools to disrupt and deter human rights abuses wherever they occur around the globe.In public and in private with Beijing, the United States has raised serious concerns about the PRC government’s abuses in Xinjiang, as well as in Hong Kong, Tibet, and other parts of China. And we have and will continue to take action. We have imposed sanctions on the PRC’s regional officials and companies for a range of human rights abuses – from torture to arbitrary detention. And we are restricting imports of goods produced with forced labor in Xinjiang.As we protect our security interests and human rights values, we will also pursue our second objective: healthy economic engagement that benefits both countries.Let’s start with the obvious. The U.S. and China are the two largest economies in the world. And we are deeply integrated with one another. Overall trade between our countries reached over $700 billion in 2021. We trade more with China than with any countries other than Canada and Mexico. American firms have extensive operations in China. Hundreds of Chinese firms are listed on our stock exchanges, which are part of the deepest and most liquid capital markets in the world. According to the Nature Index, the United States and China are each other’s most significant scientific collaborators. And China remains among the top sources for international students in the United States.As I’ve said, the United States will assert ourselves when our vital interests are at stake. But we do not seek to “decouple” our economy from China’s. A full separation of our economies would be disastrous for both countries. It would be destabilizing for the rest of the world. Rather, we know that the health of the Chinese and U.S. economies is closely linked. A growing China that plays by the rules can be beneficial for the United States. For instance, it can mean rising demand for U.S. products and services and more dynamic U.S. industries.In April 2021, I delivered my first major international economic policy speech as Treasury Secretary. I said that “credibility abroad begins with credibility at home.” At a basic level, America’s ability to compete in the 21st century turns on the choices that Washington makes – not those that Beijing makes.In the two years since my speech, the United States has pursued an economic agenda that I call modern supply-side economics. Our policies are designed to expand the productive capacity of the American economy. That is, to raise the ceiling for what our economy can produce. To do so, President Biden has signed three historic bills into law. We’ve enacted the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law – our generation’s most ambitious effort to modernize roads, bridges, and ports and broaden access to high-speed Internet. We’ve mounted a historic expansion of American semiconductor manufacturing through the CHIPS and Science Act. And we are making our nation’s largest investment in clean energy with the Inflation Reduction Act. These actions have fortified U.S. strength in the industries of the future. And they are lifting our long-term economic outlook.The United States does not seek competition that is winner-take-all. Instead, we believe that healthy economic competition with a fair set of rules can benefit both countries over time. A basic principle of economics is that sustained, repeated competition can lead to mutual improvement. Sports teams perform at a higher level when they consistently face top rivals. Firms produce better and cheaper goods when they compete for consumers. There is a world in which, as companies in the U.S. and China challenge each other, our economies can grow, standards of living can rise, and new innovations can bear fruit.For example, China has benefited from American inventions like the personal computer and the MRI. In the same way, I believe that new scientific and medical developments from China can benefit Americans and the world – and spur us to undertake even more leading-edge research and innovation.China has long used government support to help its firms gain market share at the expense of foreign competitors. But in recent years, its industrial policy has become more ambitious and complex. China has expanded support for its state-owned enterprises and domestic private firms to dominate foreign competitors. It has done so in traditional industrial sectors as well as emerging technologies. This strategy has been coupled with aggressive efforts to acquire new technological know-how and intellectual property – including through IP theft and other illicit means.Government intervention can be justified in certain circumstances – such as to correct specific market failures. But China’s government employs non-market tools at a much larger scale and breadth than other major economies. China also imposes numerous barriers to market access for American firms that do not exist for Chinese businesses in the United States. For example, Beijing has often required foreign firms to transfer proprietary technology to domestic ones – simply to do business in China. These limits on access to the Chinese market tilt the playing field in favor of Chinese firms. Further, we are concerned about a recent uptick in coercive actions targeting U.S. firms, which comes at the same moment that China states that it is re-opening for foreign investment.The actions of China’s government have had dramatic implications for the location of global manufacturing activity. And they have harmed workers and firms in the U.S. and around the world.In certain cases, China has also exploited its economic power to retaliate against and coerce vulnerable trading partners. For example, it has used boycotts of specific goods as punishment in response to diplomatic actions by other countries. China’s pretext for these actions is often commercial. But its real goal is to impose consequences on choices that it dislikes – and to force sovereign governments to capitulate to its political demands.The irony is that the open, fair, and rules-based global economy that the United States is calling for is the very same international order that helped make China’s economic transformation possible. And the inefficiencies and vulnerabilities generated by China’s unfair practices may end up hurting its own growth.China’s senior officials have repeatedly spoken about the importance of allowing markets to play a “decisive role” in resource allocation – including in a speech just earlier this year. It would be better for China and the world if Beijing were to actually shift policies in these directions and meet its own stated reform ambitions.As we press China on its unfair economic practices, we will continue to take coordinated actions with our allies and partners in response. A top priority for President Biden is the resilience of our critical supply chains. In certain sectors, China’s unfair economic practices have resulted in the over-concentration of the production of critical goods inside China. Under President Biden’s leadership, we are not only investing in manufacturing at home. We are also pursuing a strategy called “friendshoring” that is aimed at mitigating vulnerabilities that can lead to supply disruptions. We are creating redundancies in our critical supply chains with the large number of trading partners that we can count on.Of course, we know that the best way for us to strengthen the global economic order is to show the world that it works. Our investments in the international financial institutions and efforts to deepen our ties around the world are enabling more people to benefit from the international economic system. We are also accelerating our commitments in the developing world. For example, the United States and the rest of the G7 aim to mobilize $600 billion in high-quality infrastructure investments by 2027. Our focus is on projects that generate positive economic returns and foster sustainable debt for these countries. And when the international system needs updating, we will not hesitate to do so. The United States is working with shareholders to evolve the multilateral development banks to better combat today’s pressing global challenges – like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict.As we set the terms of our economic engagement with China, we will also pursue our third objective: cooperation on major global challenges. It is important that we make progress on global issues regardless of our other disagreements. That’s what the world needs from its two largest economies.As a foundation, we must continue to develop steady lines of communication between our countries for macroeconomic and financial cooperation. Economic developments in the United States and China can quickly ripple through global financial markets and the broader economy. We must maintain a robust exchange of views about how we are responding to economic shocks. My conversations with Vice Premier Liu He and China’s other senior officials have been a good start. I hope to build on them with my new counterpart.Beyond the macroeconomy, there are two specific global priorities I’d like to highlight today: debt overhang and climate change. These issues can best be managed if both countries work together, and in concert with our allies and partners.First, we must work together to help emerging markets and developing countries facing debt distress. The issue of global debt is not a bilateral issue between China and the United States. It is about responsible global leadership. China’s status as the world’s largest official bilateral creditor imposes on it the same inescapable set of responsibilities as those on other official bilateral creditors when debt cannot be fully repaid.China’s participation is essential to meaningful debt relief. But for too long, it has not moved in a comprehensive and timely manner. It has served as a roadblock to necessary action.Earlier this year, I felt the urgency of debt relief firsthand during my visit to Zambia. Government and business leaders spoke to me about how Zambia’s debt overhang has held back critical public and private investment and depressed economic development. But Zambia is not the only country in this situation. The IMF estimates that more than half of low-income countries are close to or already in debt distress. The United States has had extensive discussions with Beijing about the need for speedy debt treatment. We welcome China’s recent provision of specific and credible financing assurances for Sri Lanka, which has enabled the IMF to move forward with a program. But now, all of Sri Lanka’s bilateral creditors – including China – will need to deliver debt treatments in line with their assurances in a timely manner. We continue to urge China’s full participation to provide debt treatments in other cases in line with IMF parameters. This includes urgent cases like Zambia and Ghana.Prompt action on debt is in China’s interest. Delaying needed debt treatments raises the costs both for borrowers and creditors. It worsens borrowers’ economic fundamentals and increases the amount of debt relief they will eventually need.More broadly, there is considerable room for improvement in the international debt restructuring process. With the IMF and World Bank, we are working with a range of stakeholders to improve the Common Framework process for low-income countries and the debt treatment process more generally. As I heard from Zambian officials, solving these issues is a true test of multilateralism.Second, we must work together to tackle longstanding global challenges that threaten us all. Climate change is at the top of that list. History shows us what our two countries can do: moments of climate cooperation between the United States and China have made global breakthroughs possible, including the Paris Agreement.We have a joint responsibility to lead the way. China is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, followed by the United States. The U.S. will do its part. Over the past year, the United States has taken the boldest domestic climate action in our nation’s history. Our investments put us on track to meet U.S. commitments under the Paris Agreement and achieve net-zero by 2050. And they will have positive spillovers for the world, including through reductions in the costs of clean energy technologies. We are also working abroad to help countries make a just energy transition to reduce their carbon emissions. These transitions will also help expand energy access and provide economic opportunity for impacted communities and workers.We expect China to deliver on its commitments in our Joint Glasgow Declaration. This includes meeting mitigation targets and ending overseas financing of unabated coal-fired power plants. China should also support developing countries and emerging markets in their clean energy transitions. Further, we look forward to working together to boost private capital flows as co-chairs of the G20 working group on sustainable finance.We stand ready to work with China on the existential challenge of climate change. And we urge China to seriously engage with us and deliver on its commitments. The stakes are too high not to.Some see the relationship between the U.S. and China through the frame of great power conflict: a zero-sum, bilateral contest where one must fall for the other to rise.President Biden and I don’t see it that way. We believe that the world is big enough for both of us. China and the United States can and need to find a way to live together and share in global prosperity. We can acknowledge our differences, defend our own interests, and compete fairly. Indeed, the United States will continue to proceed with confidence about the fundamental strength of the American economy and the skill of American workers. But as President Biden said, “we share a responsibility…to prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict.”Negotiating the contours of engagement between great powers is difficult. And the United States will never compromise on our security or principles. But we can find a way forward if China is also willing to play its part.That’s why I plan to travel to China at the appropriate time. My hope is to engage in an important and substantive dialogue on economic issues with my new Chinese government counterpart following the political transition in Beijing. I believe this dialogue can help lay the groundwork for responsibly managing our bilateral relationship and cooperating on areas of shared challenge to our nations and the world.As you know, I am an economist by trade. Economics is popularly seen as a field concerning the structure and performance of entire economies. But at its most granular level, economics is much more foundational. It’s the study of the choices that people make. Specifically, how people make choices under specific circumstances – of scarcity, of risk, and sometimes, of stress. And how choices by individuals and firms affect one another, and how they add up to a national or global picture.The relationship between the United States and China is the same. Our path is not preordained, and it is not destined to be costly. The trajectory of this relationship is the aggregate of choices that all of us in these two great powers make over time – including when to cooperate, when to compete, and when to recognize that even amid our competition, we have a shared interest in peace and prosperity.The United States believes that responsible economic relations between the U.S. and China is in the self-interest of our peoples. It is the hope and expectation of the world. And at this moment of challenge, I believe it must be the choice that both countries – the United States and China – make."
138,,"April 17, 2023","Thank you to President Stoeva, Secretary General Guterres, and President of the General Assembly Kőrösi for the invitation to address this Forum. We need bold action to address the global challenges that confront us—ones that threaten to set back our progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the progress we had made on poverty reduction was beginning to lag.  Today, it is clearer than ever that transboundary challenges—such as climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict—are disproportionately affecting the poorest and most vulnerable populations. Put simply, it is no longer possible to fully deliver on our development goals without addressing global challenges with the urgency and scale required. The multilateral development banks are a key pillar of the development financing system.  That is why one of my top priorities has been to evolve these banks—so they can take decisive action on global challenges. Specifically, we have been building a large coalition of shareholders—across borrowing and non-borrowing countries, low- and middle-income countries—to press for reforms in four areas: vision and mission, incentive structures, operational approach, and financial capacity. That work has begun with the World Bank. Last week in Washington, we discussed the important progress we have made in just six months on our initiative. I am pleased with our preliminary work to refresh the Bank’s mission, which reflects the need to build resilience in the face of global challenges.  We are updating the Bank’s operational approach and removing institutional constraints to addressing global challenges at speed and at scale. This includes updating our approach to diagnostics, country strategies, and incentives for private capital and domestic resource mobilization.  And we are generating additional financial capacity by stretching the Bank’s balance sheet in a financially responsible manner. Yet there is more work to be done. The United States and other shareholders are calling for an ambitious workplan through October and beyond, leveraging major international gatherings to drive progress.  We look forward to continuing to work with the World Bank and all its shareholders on this initiative."
139,,"April 13, 2023","I am happy to welcome you all to the Treasury Department.  It is a pleasure to be sitting down with colleagues from across Latin America and the Caribbean.
 We are gathering today in the wake of three years of momentous changes across the global landscape. Our macroeconomic, trade, security, and health frameworks have been forever altered by a confluence of geopolitical, health, and economic shocks.
 But the events of the past three years have also brought about opportunities to become more resilient, to lift barriers to economic growth, to make smarter investments in inclusive societies, and to increase our appreciation of the planet and the friends and neighbors with whom we share it.
 We have been seeing and hearing each other on the margins of these important Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank, where I have been discussing a range of priorities with counterparts, including the global economic outlook and continued impact of Russia’s war on Ukraine; evolution of the MDBs; and our continued work on sovereign debt vulnerabilities and climate change.  

It is also important to use this week to connect with our own neighbors in a more intimate setting; hearing your concerns, sharing experiences, and figuring out how we can work together for a stronger, safer, and more prosperous hemispheric community.

This is what tonight’s dinner is about.  

We crafted the discussion agenda with a mind to recognize our shared challenges, leverage our comparative advantages, and strengthen our abilities to respond to the upheaval of the past three years and the challenges of today and tomorrow.

First, I invite discussion of our shared challenges to secure the gains of pandemic recovery while restoring macroeconomic buffers.  

After the pandemic, all of us are facing raised expectations from our citizens for better government. We all learned hard lessons on the importance of flexible policy, and of having strong macroeconomic buffers.
 
At the same time, all of us are experiencing inflation that is higher, and more stubborn, than anticipated.

That inflation is also driving up borrowing costs and for some, limiting market access. 

Several of my colleagues here have limits on their deficits, and the imperative of reducing debt will be challenging.

Next will be the topic of what some have called “friend shoring.”  Pandemic disruptions, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and national security concerns arising from technology transfer to China’s military-industrial complex have exposed the fragility of extended supply chains, and businesses are looking for solutions.  
 This is an enormous opportunity for all of us—not just those of us with critical minerals, but all who are looking to climb the value chain.  I will be eager to learn from your approaches and discuss how our policies can be mutually reinforcing to promote investments in supply chains that are dynamic and resilient.
 Our third discussion topic is climate.  How to build resilience to jarring changes, how to adapt to and mitigate the warming trajectory, and how to seize opportunities to invest in the economy of tomorrow are pressing challenges for us all.  It will be crucial to deploy public investment that compensates for market failures where they exist and will crowd in private capital where market forces can drive innovation.

I look forward to a frank and open discussion.  Thank you again for joining us here.

140,,"April 13, 2023","During my visit, I saw firsthand the bravery and resilience of the Ukrainian military and people. I remember visiting a school that had been damaged in the initial Russian onslaught. There, I saw students working with community members to make trench candles to send to the front lines.It was deeply moving for me to see how Ukrainians have stood strong to defend their homeland and democratic values in the face of Russia’s brutal, destructive war.Make no mistake: the United States has stood with Ukraine since Day One of this war. And we will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.The United States is proud to be a leading partner for Ukraine. We have disbursed significant economic support since the start of the war and will provide more in the upcoming months. This is in addition to our security and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.As President Zelensky said, this support is not charity – it’s an investment in democracy and global security. It comes with important safeguards to ensure that it is used effectively and delivers for the people of Ukraine.And by supporting the Ukrainian home front – keeping children in school, hospitals open, and first responders on the job – we are helping to underpin the brave resistance of Ukrainians fighting on the front lines for their freedom.Two weeks ago, the IMF Board approved a milestone $15.6 billion dollar program for Ukraine, providing critical financing to Ukraine and helping to establish a robust macroeconomic reform agenda.The program demonstrates the international community’s collective commitment to supporting Ukraine. And it provides a macroeconomic and financial framework that will underpin Ukraine’s reform efforts while enabling it to rebuild, enhance the resilience of its economy, and achieve debt sustainability.Today, the Prime Minister and I discussed how Ukraine will use this international support to achieve these goals. I commend your commitment to meeting the reform agenda and benchmarks outlined in the IMF program.Coupled with your administration’s dedication to accountability, good governance, and ensuring that international assistance is used responsibly, I believe that this commitment is a significant step toward putting Ukraine on a sound economic path.In addition to providing economic support, we are leading a coalition of more than 30 countries to mount the swiftest, most unified, and most ambitious sanctions regime in modern history to limit Russia’s ability to wage its immoral war. We continue our work to impose sanctions and vigorously address evasion.Prime Minister Shmyhal, I want to reiterate that the United States will stand with you for as long as it takes. Thank you for visiting Washington this week, and I look forward to continuing to work together to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people."
141,,"April 13, 2023","Good morning, thank you all for being here today. I am pleased to join Her Excellency Sri Mulyani Indrawati in signing the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s Compact with the Government of Indonesia.This Compact is a tangible expression of the important partnership between the United States and Indonesia, grounded in our shared belief in democracy, innovation-driven economic growth, and investing in our people.These tenets also underpin the Millennium Challenge Corporation’s unique model, guiding its mission to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth.The $649 million Compact with Indonesia represents a catalytic use of grant funds to improve infrastructure, increase access to finance, and promote women’s economic empowerment.The Compact will leverage Indonesia’s own resources rather than simply adding to them, making use of the Government of Indonesia's own funding and revenue-generating models that can be taken up and expanded upon by the private sector.I am particularly pleased that the Compact also supports the Just Energy Transition Partnership with Indonesia. This is a fine example of the partnership between our two countries and a testament to both the United States’ dedication to bold and impactful climate action and Indonesia's admirably high climate ambition.The Compact includes $50 million in grants that will lower financing costs to catalyze private investment in Indonesia's transition, including coal decommissioning, and $15 million in technical assistance that will help Indonesia accelerate its transition to a cleaner energy future.We are working, along with our public and private partners, to support Indonesia’s development of an Investment and Policy Plan to direct implementation of the partnership over the next three to five years.Through this Compact and our Just Energy Transition Partnership with Indonesia, we are not only delivering on strong emissions reductions, but taking a people-centered approach to driving sustainable development and economic growth. It is vital that the energy transition be just.The time is now for creative solutions, for innovative partnerships, and for heightened ambition in investments in sustainable infrastructure and climate resilience.Transformative collaborations such as the Compact we are signing today will help us deliver on our collective commitment, and indeed obligation, to secure a sustainable future for all."
142,,"April 12, 2023","""Six months ago during the Annual Meetings, I set forward a call to action to the multilateral development banks to evolve to meet the challenges and opportunities we face now. Today, the World Bank took an important step forward in that effort. Together, we are redoubling the World Bank’s work on global challenges like climate change, while advancing the Bank’s vital efforts to eliminate extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. The reforms affirmed by the Development Committee will sharpen the Bank’s mission, align its operations with our new goals, and help unlock as much as $50 billion in lending capacity over the coming decade to combat extreme poverty, boost economic growth, and build resilience in the face of global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility.I thank President Malpass, the staff of the World Bank, and fellow shareholders for their tireless work in shaping the World Bank’s evolution to date. But we’re not done yet. These reforms provide a strong foundation to energize the next phase of the work over the coming months. I look forward to Ajay Banga’s leadership as the next President of the World Bank, and I am confident he has the right experience and track record of bringing together governments, the private sector, and non-profits to deliver on our ambitious goals."""
143,,"April 12, 2023","It is good to see you, President Zelenskyy and Prime Minister Shmyhal.  During my trip to Kyiv in February, I witnessed firsthand the brutality of Russia’s illegal war.  I also saw the resilience of the Ukrainian people. Your government has provided a steady hand for Ukraine amid Russia’s horrific war.  Economic activity is recovering under difficult conditions, and critical government services are being delivered.I commend your ongoing focus on good governance and anticorruption.  Your commitment to making sure that international assistance is being used responsibly is essential.The United States is proud to have provided significant budget support since Russia’s invasion.  We have current plans to provide additional aid through September—all as grants—as well as to provide support for energy security and early recovery. I thank the World Bank for safeguarding and facilitating disbursements, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for being an implementation partner.Supporting Ukraine is a collective effort.  We welcome the efforts by our allies and partners to provide significant, predictable, and timely assistance, and urge all of us to continue doing so.  The World Bank’s update to its Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment underscores Ukraine’s needs.Just as military assistance provides for the front lines, our economic assistance bolsters the home front.  It keeps the government and economy running so Ukraine can continue to defend itself.Meanwhile, our historic multilateral sanctions coalition is restricting Russia’s access to the technology and equipment it needs to supply its military. And with our embargoes and price caps on Russian oil and refined products, we are effectively targeting Russia’s key source of revenue while maintaining stability in global oil markets.  Russian state revenue from energy taxes is down over 40% since the imposition of the price cap compared to last year.We are proud to stand with Ukraine.  And, as President Biden has said, the United States will do what it takes to support Ukraine, for as long as it takes."

This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here.

146,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

148,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
149,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1. For additional analysis on Treasury market liquidity conditions, see (for example): “Resilience redux in the Treasury Market” by Darrell Duffie (August 25, 2023) and “How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Evolved in 2023” by Michael Fleming (October 17, 2023).2. Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

150,,"April 12, 2023","As everyone in this room knows, we are at an important moment for the World Bank. Six months ago, ahead of the Annual Meetings, I issued an urgent call for the evolution of the multilateral development bank system to better meet the challenges we face in an interconnected world.The MDBs have undergone significant transformations throughout their history to reflect a changing global landscape. Now, almost 80 years after the founding of the World Bank, we call on these MDBs to evolve again to take decisive action on 21st century global challenges and redouble their vital development and poverty reduction work.We need to seize this moment. We know that global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict are increasing in scope and complexity. And we know that they are disproportionately impacting the poorest and most vulnerable.First, we have sharpened the mission of the World Bank. The Bank’s mission now highlights the importance of inclusion, sustainability, and resilience to global shocks in achieving its Twin Goals. In short, we have a Bank that strives to end extreme poverty, boost shared prosperity, and build resilience.This does not mean we are moving away from the Bank’s traditional work. Rather, our incorporation of global challenges enhances the Bank’s work on poverty reduction and development. These goals are all interconnected.The women small holder farmers I met in Zambia earlier this year understand firsthand how climate change is dampening agricultural yields. And we’ve all seen how threats to global health can disrupt entire societies and economies, and how fragility and conflict can lead to significant displacement and migrant flows.We know that a country’s development challenges emanate not only from country-specific factors; they can also emerge from regional and global challenges. The Bank will move toward systematically integrating these challenges in its diagnostic work and country engagement.Other operational reforms include bolstering the Bank’s crisis response toolkit and prioritizing mobilization of additional private capital and domestic resources.The Bank has a long tradition of undertaking financial innovations to responsibly stretch its existing balance sheet. Shareholders have agreed to undertake reforms that could add up to $50 billion in financing over the next 10 years – while protecting the Bank’s credit rating and long-term financial sustainability.These are very significant achievements. We should acknowledge and celebrate that – especially our Board members who worked so hard with Bank management and staff. And then we need to push for more progress. We should use the rest of the year to undertake additional reforms through a staged implementation approach that can be agreed upon by the Board and implemented on a rolling basis.We can leverage upcoming events to keep the momentum strong – including the Summit for a New Global Financial Pact in June, the G20 Leaders’ Summit in September, the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in October, and COP28 in November and December.President Malpass – thank you for your leadership of the first stage of the evolution initiative. Thank you also to Bank management and staff for all the work that has gotten us to this point. We recognize that delivering these reforms is no easy task.In the coming weeks, we will elect new leadership at the World Bank that can carry this work forward. I believe that Ajay Banga – U.S. nominee for President of the World Bank – is the right leader to take the baton from President Malpass and accelerate our work to evolve this institution.Today, I look forward to hearing your initial remarks on how the evolution agenda at the World Bank can best be taken forward. And during the roundtable portion of the meeting, I’m eager to learn about how you see global challenges impacting development. I’d also like to hear about what reforms you believe the World Bank should implement to help address these challenges. This will be helpful as we move into the second stage of implementation."
151,,"April 11, 2023","It is always a pleasure to visit one of the most dynamic economies in the world, and Bengaluru served as an important opportunity to make progress on many of our shared goals.I want to commend your presidency for its focus on advancing the evolution of the multilateral development banks.  As you know, this initiative is a priority of mine and will be a major focus of our conversations this week.The G20 can bring strong political momentum to bear to make sure that the multilateral development banks accelerate their work on 21st century global challenges as part of their effort to end extreme poverty and expand shared prosperity. And, of course, Ajay was born and spent much of his career in India.  He has a keen understanding of the economic opportunities present in developing countries that will serve him well if he’s selected. The United States also applauds your efforts to transition to renewable energy and stands ready to provide support in achieving your target of 500 gigawatts of non-fossil generation capacity by 2030.   "
152,,"April 4, 2023","Thank you all very much for having me at the IRS today. I’m thrilled to be here with you to swear in our new Commissioner of the IRS: Danny Werfel. I’d also like to acknowledge all of the former Commissioners here.As everyone in this room knows, Danny will lead the IRS through an important transition. For decades, the IRS had suffered from chronic underinvestment. But last summer, the President secured funding in the Inflation Reduction Act that will transform the IRS into a modern, 21st century agency.But this is no small task. Realizing the promise of this investment requires concerted leadership and a strong team. Before I speak about Danny himself, let me outline the two major priorities that he will be focused on: dramatically improving taxpayer service and ensuring that large corporations and the wealthy pay the taxes they owe.Let me begin with our effort to provide world-class service to American taxpayers. For years, severe underfunding of the IRS meant that it could not deliver the type of service that taxpayers needed. IRS employees will be the first to tell you that too many calls went unanswered and too many taxpayers went without support. The IRS remained a primarily paper-based agency – one where employees still opened, and in certain cases, transcribed paper returns digit-by-digit. I come to you today with good news. Thanks to the dedication of IRS employees, we’ve made significant strides in the short eight months since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. To start, the IRS has hired 5,000 new customer service staff and improved automated phone and chat features. Taxpayers can now receive refunds directly into their bank account for items like the 1040X amended returns. They can fill out certain forms online rather than on paper. And they can respond to numerous notices on IRS.gov rather than through the mail. The agency is now consistently achieving a level of service with live assistance between 80 and 90 percent. That’s a dramatic improvement compared to around 15 percent during the previous filing season. And as of January, the IRS had worked through more inventory in the previous 12 months than during any one-year period in history.Of course, we still have more work to do. We must invest in technology that unlocks increased productivity for IRS employees, improves automated services for taxpayers, and digitizes many processes that for too long have been handled on paper. Importantly, these technological improvements will not just speed up processes. They will help taxpayers identify and avoid errors before they file their returns. We also need to meet taxpayers where they are. That is why we have taken steps to reopen and fully staff Taxpayer Assistance Centers across the country. These centers offer free tax help – to address complex tax questions and support those who face language barriers. We also need to make sure that small businesses and individuals can access the tax credits and incentives that they are eligible for. Our investments in the IRS will result in more streamlined and accurate delivery of these credits and incentives to Americans across the country. Our second priority is to ensure fair enforcement of our tax laws. Absent our new investment in the IRS, the tax gap – the gap between taxes owed and those actually paid – was estimated at around $7 trillion over the next decade. Much of this was because the IRS lacked the resources to effectively audit wealthy taxpayers and complex businesses. The top 1 percent of Americans account for a disproportionate share of unpaid taxes.The IRS will invest in data and analytics to help the agency audit large corporations, high earners, and complex partnerships that have not paid their full bill. The technology will be complemented by hiring more top talent – including accountants and attorneys. These additional resources will help us peel back complex corporate structures and large taxpaying entities – and make sure that they pay what they owe. As I’ve said before, I have directed that that these resources will not be used to increase the audit rate for small businesses and households making under $400,000 a year, relative to historical levels. Just as importantly, we are committed to helping taxpayers get it right. Through our enhanced service, we are answering questions in a timely fashion and expanding our support and outreach to underserved communities. We expect that this initiative will help reduce enforcement actions on honest taxpayers. In all, we expect that these investments in fair enforcement will reduce our deficits by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade. Danny has the deep management experience required to lead significant organizational transformation. For decades, he has served as a leader across the private and public sectors – including in both Democratic and Republican Administrations. His service at OMB, DOJ, the private sector – and his previous tour of duty at the IRS – have more than prepared him for this job. Importantly, Danny has a deep commitment to fairness and good government. Danny, I hope that the honor and pride you feel today reminds you of how you felt when you joined the government as a policy analyst a quarter-century ago.  Importantly, I know that Danny will not be alone in this mission. I have heard countless stories of IRS employees going above and beyond – particularly over the last three years. You’ve worked nights and weekends. You’ve helped deliver critical economic relief to Americans during a once-in-a-century pandemic – all amid severe resource constraints. I know that Danny will lead the IRS with the same dedication to the mission that you all share.Congratulations, Danny. I look forward to working together with you and your team at this critical juncture for the IRS. And now, Danny – I’d like to invite you and your family to join me for the oath of office. "
153,,"March 31, 2023","Washington – Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement on the IMF Executive Board’s approval of Ukraine’s economic program.“I welcome the IMF approval of a $15.6 billion economic program for Ukraine. I commend Ukraine’s efforts to pursue broad-based structural reforms under the program despite Russia’s brutal and immoral war and strongly support the program’s measures aimed at securing economic and financial stability. The program’s policies and reforms will support economic growth, strengthen good governance and anti-corruption efforts, and set the foundation for longer-term reconstruction.The IMF’s financial assistance is a critical component in the international community’s collective support to Ukraine and will supplement the economic assistance provided by the United States to fund essential services like schools, hospitals, and first responders, as well as the funding from our partners. I want to thank IMF staff for their tireless work and close engagement with the Ukrainian government, the United States, including our dedicated staff at Treasury and other partners of Ukraine in bringing this program to fruition. I’m also pleased that the group of official creditors to Ukraine, consisting of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, have provided financing assurances to support Ukraine’s debt sustainability under the IMF program. I call on all other official and private creditors to join this initiative to assist Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia’s unprovoked war. The United States will continue to stand by Ukraine and its people for as long as it takes.”"
154,,"March 30, 2023","I am especially privileged to receive a lifetime achievement award named after Paul Volcker – a titan in the field of economics. Paul may best be known for his work as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. But his legacy extends far beyond that role. Indeed, Treasury has a special claim to him too. Paul spent nearly a decade of his career working for our Department. As Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs, he shepherded our country’s transition from one monetary system to another – and with it, a change in America’s role in the global economy. Among the many posts in his long and varied career, Paul later called his role at Treasury “the best job in the world.” With apologies to my former Fed colleagues, we at Treasury take special pride in that.In the last decade of his life, Paul also left an indelible mark on the field of financial stability. Paul was an outspoken champion for stronger regulation to prevent future financial crises. He led President Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board, counseled the Administration on key changes to the financial architecture, and advocated firmly and publicly for the banking rule that bears his name.Like Paul, and many of the economists here, I am no stranger to financial crises. My career has spanned almost two decades at the Fed, nearly three years at the Council of Economic Advisors, and over two years now at the Treasury Department. In that time, I have seen the U.S. and global financial systems undergo a number of significant disruptions: the Asian Financial Crisis, the dot-com crash, the Global Financial Crisis, and the COVID-19 market turmoil. I understand deeply the fear and uncertainty that these disruptions can cause. And I know well the longer-term pain that these disruptions can impose on American families and businesses when they are not decisively managed. These risks were top of mind as we took forceful and immediate actions earlier this month to contain the fallout from the failures of two regional banking institutions.One constant across these disruptions has been a perennial debate about the proper role of government in regulating the financial sector. Waves of financial regulation have often been followed by concerted efforts at deregulation – premised on the belief that regulation is ineffective and stifles financial innovation and economic growth. I have lived through efforts like these, such as the massive pushback against the Dodd-Frank Act’s enactment and implementation. My response has always been that a stable and resilient financial system is not only compatible with responsible innovation and sustainable growth. In fact, it is a prerequisite for those goals.Our prosperity depends on the work to safeguard financial stability before a crisis occurs – just as the implementation of a strong fire code can prevent a fire from breaking out. That work mattered in 2020, when a worldwide pandemic-driven “dash for cash” put extraordinary strain on the financial system. A decade of focused work to improve financial stability – coupled with forceful public-sector interventions – helped us avoid the worst possible economic outcomes. This work also mattered earlier this month, when we encountered two bank failures with a stronger financial system and hard-earned lessons from the Global Financial Crisis.We have made much progress in the past 15 years. But recent events show that, clearly, our work is not done. During the COVID pandemic and again this month, the proverbial fire department had to be called – in the form of interventions by the Fed, FDIC, and Treasury. These events remind us of the urgent need to complete unfinished business: to finalize post-crisis reforms, consider whether deregulation may have gone too far, and repair the cracks in the regulatory perimeter that the recent shocks have revealed. We must also address new areas of risk.Since my first day at Treasury, I have made it a major priority to restore and strengthen our financial stability apparatus. My remarks today will outline the importance of this work to the American economy. I will establish why financial stability matters to American families, before turning to how our financial system has performed through its most serious tests since the Global Financial Crisis. Then, I will speak about the progress that we’ve made on our financial stability agenda and the road ahead.Simply put, we care about financial stability because families and businesses benefit from a well-functioning financial system. Conversely, they bear the costs of its failures.When the financial system works, it can be a powerful engine for economic growth. Financial institutions provide credit that enables families to afford homes, invest in education, and otherwise improve their standards of living. Borrowing helps business owners form new ventures and expand existing ones, leading to innovation and job creation. The financial system also gives families and businesses safe places to save, invest, and transact. At a broader level, it helps us efficiently allocate capital across the many productive uses in society.But a fragile financial system can generate deep pain for American households when it fails. The Global Financial Crisis led to the longest recession in the postwar era. Over 8 million Americans lost their jobs. The net worth of U.S. households fell by over $10 trillion at the lowest point in the crisis. And the long-term unemployment rate did not recover for over a decade. Jorda, Schularick, and Taylor have found that recessions following financial crises are deeper than other downturns. The recoveries are slower too.1 One study put the price tag of lost output following the Global Financial Crisis at nearly a half to a full year of U.S. GDP. That’s the equivalent of $50,000 to $120,000 for every U.S. household.2 And the pain was not evenly distributed. Families in the bottom half of the distribution lost decades of gains in household wealth – while the top lost little.3Studies show that weak financial systems can amplify business cycles. In a seminal 1999 paper, Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist concluded that endogenous developments in credit markets can serve as a “financial accelerator.” That is, they can turn relatively small shocks into large fluctuations in aggregate economic activity – including more severe economic downturns.4 Nellie Liang, our Under Secretary for Domestic Finance, has produced with other scholars a helpful analytic approach called “growth at risk.”5 They conclude that loose financial conditions may support economic growth in the near-term. But that comes at the expense of increased downside risks in the medium term if loose conditions are accompanied by rapid credit growth.The United States has an extensive history of federal financial regulation – one that dates back to the Civil War. Through much of the 20th century, regulators primarily focused on the safety and soundness of banks, along with investor protection and market integrity. But the Global Financial Crisis made clear that this focus was too narrow. Today’s financial system is characterized by increased complexity and interconnection across market actors and geographic boundaries. A single point of failure can cascade through the system like a wildfire – leading to a failure of the financial system to perform its core functions. In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, the United States and many countries pursued new macroprudential policies designed to mitigate systemic risk.Our goal as policymakers is to build a financial system that can provide core financial services in both good and bad times. Macroprudential policy is not aimed at preventing external shocks nor eliminating all volatility in the financial system. Rather, macroprudential policy aims to make the financial system more resilient to external shocks – so the system can dampen, not amplify, their consequences for American households and businesses. We also aim to prevent the financial system itself from becoming a source of shocks – like it was in 2008.Let’s take the basic concept of fire sales. As described by Shleifer and Vishny, a fire sale is the forced sale of assets at a price below fundamental values.6 Building on this idea, Brunnermeier and Pedersen show how a negative shock to the net worth of collateralized borrowers can trigger a vicious cycle of forced asset sales.7 The resulting price declines trigger further forced sales. At each stage, the net worth of leveraged investors falls, requiring additional liquidations.Of course, the concept of a fire sale is broader than the specific mechanism embodied in the Shleifer-Vishny or Brunnermeier-Pedersen models. Just as the original spark for a real fire can come from many sources, the trigger for systemic stress is often difficult to predict. But there are common vulnerabilities and transmission channels through which financial fires can get out of hand. Excessive leverage, especially when paired with maturity and liquidity mismatches, can increase the risk that fires spread out of control.Information asymmetries can also lead to runs that have the potential to accelerate and deepen asset fire sales. This dynamic was highlighted in the research that won Diamond and Dybvig the Nobel Prize with Bernanke last year.8 Earlier this month, we saw one example of how dangerous these sorts of runs can be – as customers withdrew deposits from Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank en masse.The fire analogy should make the fundamental rationale for macroprudential financial regulation intuitively clear. Due to the externalities created by fires that can rage out of control, every community has both fire codes and fire departments. Fire departments are there to extinguish fires. But importantly, fire codes are there to prevent fires from starting and spreading in the first place.In the United States, Congress passed stricter fire codes in the form of stronger standards for systemically important banks, financial market utilities, and other firms. These reforms were designed to reduce their probability of failure and force them to internalize the cost of spillovers. Congress also created firebreaks between certain large firms and their neighbors, requiring them to plan for their own recovery and resolution. New smoke alarms were affixed to the financial system through the creation of the Office of Financial Research at the Treasury Department. That office was tasked with collecting financial data to help identify potential risks. And of course, there was a new fire marshal in town. Congress established the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, to coordinate among agencies to identify and respond to emerging threats to U.S. financial stability.We also knew that financial risks rarely respect national borders. In the years following the crisis, we built up the Financial Stability Board in partnership with other G20 members. We improved communication and coordination for stronger standards for financial stability policy, while also creating robust networks for responding to future crises.The biggest test came in March 2020 – just shy of a decade after the passage of Dodd-Frank. As the coronavirus spread rapidly across the world and governments issued stay-at-home orders, economic uncertainty and financial panic set in. What followed were historic selloffs in a broad range of financial assets – from equities to corporate and municipal bonds. Treasury yields rose as investors sought cash in this highly uncertain moment. The S&P 500 painted a clear picture of the panic. It tripped three circuit-breakers in the span of a week as the stock market recorded historic drops.Over the past year, the financial system has gone through additional tests as financial conditions have tightened. Earlier this month, SVB failed to adequately account for interest rate risks and suffered a run accelerated by the bank’s outsized vulnerabilities. Its failure – along with that of Signature Bank – created a serious risk for contagious runs at other banks.It is notable that neither of these events triggered the worst-case scenario – a financial meltdown like we saw in 2007 and 2008. In large part, this was due to the post-crisis reforms we put in place. But in both cases, the government had to deliver substantial interventions to ease the pressure on certain parts of the financial system.Let me begin with the banking system. During the March 2020 panic, banks served as an important pillar of strength for the financial system. Large banks were better capitalized and more liquid than they were in 2007. Dodd-Frank imposed significant reforms designed to ensure these institutions could better absorb losses and meet customer demands for credit and cash.But the failures of two regional banks this month demonstrate that our business is unfinished. To be clear, the banking system is significantly stronger than it was heading into the Global Financial Crisis. This is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that we’ve seen relative stability in the overall banking sector this month, even as concerns grew about specific institutions. Still, any time a bank fails, it is cause for serious concern. Regulatory requirements have been loosened in recent years. I believe it is appropriate to assess the impact of these deregulatory decisions and take any necessary actions in response.We must also address vulnerabilities in the nonbank sector. Some nonbanks – or “shadow banks” – consist of financial companies that carry out traditional banking functions, but are outside of, or only loosely linked to, depository institutions. They have grown substantially in the past few decades. In the United States, credit provided by nonbanks – measured relative to GDP – has more than doubled from 1985 to today.9 This same measure has remained relatively flat for banks.In many sectors, nonbanks have increased competition, fostered innovation, and broadened access to credit. But in March 2020, nonbanks and others pulled back from important credit markets. Extraordinary intervention by the government was necessary to stabilize these distressed markets and maintain a sufficient flow of credit to households and businesses. Put simply, the COVID shock reaffirmed the significance of structural vulnerabilities in nonbanks. Now, our duty as policymakers is to respond.When the President and I took office in January 2021, we inherited a financial stability apparatus at Treasury that had been decimated. For example, I walked in to find an FSOC team that was less than one third of the size it was five years prior. In 2016, FSOC’s policy, analysis, and operations teams were fully staffed. By 2021, the analysis team had been eliminated. This team, working with financial regulators, was responsible for helping monitor systemic risk. This meant that we went into the pandemic crisis without the staffing we needed to monitor risks to the health of the financial system.Over the past two years, I have made it a top priority to rebuild the financial stability infrastructure at Treasury. We have doubled the size of our FSOC staff, with plans to accelerate hiring in the coming months. Importantly, we have recommitted to our partnership with regulators to make progress on our financial stability agenda.Federal regulators are in the process of reviewing events surrounding the failure of SVB. It’s important that I don’t prejudge the conclusions of their inquiry. So let me focus instead on our response to the situation that we encountered.Earlier this month, we learned about a situation at SVB that required immediate action. The institution was experiencing a classic Diamond-Dybvig bank run – fueled by uncertainty about the value of its assets. This run was accelerated by unique features of SVB’s deposit base. The bank’s depositors were highly correlated, and an unusually high share of its deposits was uninsured. Withdrawals were occurring at a remarkable speed.Faced with this run, the federal government took decisive action to restore and strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system. Treasury worked with the Fed and FDIC to protect depositors in the resolution of SVB. We also took the same action for Signature Bank – another institution that faced a run at around the same time. This meant that all customers at SVB and Signature Bank received access to their insured and uninsured deposits almost immediately. To be clear, the steps we took were not focused on aiding specific banks or customers. Our intervention was necessary to mitigate systemic risks and protect the broader U.S. banking system. We also took these actions without protecting the banks’ investors or managers. In addition to these specific actions, the Fed established a new lending facility to provide additional liquidity to the banking system.Today, the U.S. banking system is sound, even as it has come under pressure. The new Fed facility and discount window lending are working as intended to help banks meet the needs of all of their depositors. The capital and liquidity positions of the overall system remain at strong levels. And as we continue to monitor conditions, let me be clear: this month’s developments have been very different than those of the Global Financial Crisis. Back then, many financial institutions came under stress due to their holdings of subprime assets. We do not see that situation in the banking system today.Even in a well-regulated system, public confidence is key. When there are cracks in confidence in the banking system, the government must act immediately. This includes making forceful interventions – like we did. As I have said, we have used important tools to act quickly to prevent contagion. And they are tools we could use again. The strong actions we have taken ensure that Americans’ deposits are safe. And we would be prepared to take additional actions if warranted.It's also important that we reexamine whether our current supervisory and regulatory regimes are adequate for the risks that banks face today. We must act to address these risks if necessary. Regulation imposes costs on firms, just like fire codes do for property owners. But the costs of proper regulation pale in comparison to the tragic costs of financial crises.Our Administration is committed to making sure that the U.S. banking system remains the strongest and safest in the world. As we consider next steps, it is vital that we ensure the health and competitiveness of our vibrant community and regional banking institutions. The American economy benefits enormously from our broad and diverse banking system.As we strengthen the banking sector, we are also making progress on one of FSOC’s top priorities: mitigating vulnerabilities in nonbank financial intermediation. Many of these nonbank institutions engage in liquidity and maturity transformation: they profit by issuing short-term obligations while investing in riskier and longer-term assets. But they are generally not regulated to account for spillovers to the rest of the financial system during times of extreme stress.There are two guiding principles in our work on nonbanks. First, policymakers should address risks regardless of where they emanate from. Substance is more important than form; similar activities that create comparable financial stability risks should be subject to comparable regulatory scrutiny. Second, policymakers should adapt and tailor policies to fit the unique structural features of the institutions and markets they are regulating. For example, systemic liquidity risks should be addressed wherever they exist. But specific policy responses should differ depending on the specific activity involved.These principles prevent risks from shifting around in the financial system in response to regulation. They enable us to address risks wherever they are found.We have pursued work on nonbanks that are both inside and outside the traditional financial system. First, let me speak on nonbanks inside the traditional system.If there is any place where the vulnerabilities of the system to runs and fire sales have been clear-cut, it is money market funds. These funds are widely used by retail and institutional investors for cash management; they provide a close substitute for bank deposits. Before the post-crisis reforms implemented by the SEC, all money market funds were generally expected to maintain a fixed $1 net asset value per share. The stable NAV was normally achievable because funds were generally limited to investments that were considered to be low risk. These funds were allowed to round their share prices to $1 when the market value of their investments fell – as long as it stayed above a certain level. But a fund had to respond if its market value fell below that level – that is, if it “broke the buck.” In that case, these funds would have to reprice, and they might cease withdrawals and liquidate their assets.10This created an incentive for a run in times of extreme stress. The first redeemers could exit the fund at $1 per share, but those who waited might be subject to a reduced market value as they are left with claims on less-liquid assets. This created a “first-mover advantage” – an incentive for investors to redeem at the whiff of a problem. During the Global Financial Crisis, anticipated losses on Lehman Brothers commercial paper led to a run on the $62 billion Reserve Primary Fund, the oldest money market fund in the nation. Concerns about Lehman then sparked concerns about commercial paper issued by other banks. This led to runs on other money market funds. A post-mortem report revealed that as many as 28 other funds had NAVs low enough for them to also break the buck.11Even without a fixed NAV, liquidity mismatch in other kinds of funds can still make them vulnerable to runs and fire sales. Open-end funds offer daily redemptions, but some hold assets that cannot be sold quickly – particularly in large volumes. Like money market funds, this liquidity mismatch does not typically pose problems in normal times when flows to and from funds are not outsized. But in times of market stress, shareholders are incentivized to redeem early – before fire sales of illiquid assets lower the value of their holdings. Driven by this dynamic amid the pandemic shock, a record $255 billion flowed out of bond mutual funds in March 2020.12The structural vulnerabilities at the heart of money market and open-end funds aren’t new. In the banking sector, capital and liquidity requirements and federal deposit insurance reduce the likelihood of runs taking place. In case runs occur, access to the discount window helps provide buffers for banks. Yet the financial stability risks posed by money market and open-end funds have not been sufficiently addressed.Over the past two years, the SEC has proposed rules to mitigate the vulnerabilities plaguing these funds.13 The SEC’s proposals would reduce the first-mover advantage, reducing run incentives during times of stress. They would also require new liquidity management tools, while mandating more comprehensive and timely information on these funds for the SEC and investors.Abroad, Treasury has worked with the FSB to advance international commitments that enhance the resilience of money market funds. We will soon review the implementation – and later the effectiveness – of reforms taken by member jurisdictions. Treasury is also working diligently in the FSB to revise recommendations on liquidity management in open-end funds to bolster their resilience.The hedge fund industry has expanded significantly over the last five years. In 2021, gross assets reached almost $10 trillion, up more than 50 percent since 2016.14 Hedge funds are also playing a more prominent role in markets that lie at the core of the financial system – like the U.S. Treasury market.Overall use of leverage among hedge funds is fairly small on average. But leverage appears to be concentrated among a select number of large hedge funds. Twenty-five funds account for around half of all hedge fund borrowing and derivatives exposures.15 Further, funds with certain strategies are engaged in very significant use of leverage.Leverage can support economic growth, but excessive leverage is dangerous. It can add fuel to fire sales by triggering a negative spiral of margin calls and rapid asset liquidations. These fire sales can transmit stress to hedge fund counterparties and other market participants – including large, systemic banks. Post-crisis banking regulations have helped reduce the potential of spillovers to the banking system. But spillovers from these fire sales to other market participants remain a risk.In March 2020, these risks became reality. For example, hedge funds were among the top three sellers of Treasury securities that month. FSOC has determined that they materially contributed to Treasury market dysfunction.16First, we restored FSOC’s Hedge Fund Working Group, which had previously been disbanded. No single regulator has the authority or information to comprehensively assess the risks posed by hedge funds. So, the working group has developed a risk monitoring framework to identify hedge fund-related risks to the financial system. The framework is based on data from the SEC’s Form PF, which was initiated after the financial crisis, as well as supervisory information from relevant agencies. This group reports regularly to FSOC and will develop policy recommendations – if it is determined that leverage or other vulnerabilities are significantly increasing financial stability risks. Second, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research will continue to enhance data collection on bilateral repo transactions without a central counterparty. These are a key source of leverage for hedge funds. This collection will also help to close a large remaining gap for Treasury market data. And it will be important for Treasury’s broader efforts to advance reforms with financial regulators that improve the resilience of the Treasury market, which has seen some episodes of stress in recent years.17New technologies have the potential to provide faster, safer, and cheaper financial services. They can also foster greater financial inclusion. But as we’ve learned from history, innovation without adequate regulation can result in significant disruptions and harm.Over the past decade, the digital assets ecosystem has grown significantly in scope and scale. It has also been subject to significant shocks and volatility. In November 2021, global market capitalization reached approximately $3 trillion.18 Just over half a year later, it lost two-thirds of its value – and has not markedly recovered since then.We have been vigilant in monitoring the potential systemic risks of digital assets since before the collapse of FTX and other platforms. In 2021, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued recommendations for stablecoin regulation. And last year, Treasury and other agencies released a series of reports on digital assets policy in response to an executive order by President Biden. Out of this effort, we identified areas of further work and coordination among the financial agencies, as well as gaps in existing authority that would require legislation. Take the example of stablecoins. Today, stablecoins are frequently used to pay for speculative crypto-assets. But they could be used more widely for payments for other goods and services. After all, stablecoins are designed specifically with the goal of maintaining a stable value. Typically, that is one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. The largest stablecoins seek to maintain this peg by backing the coin with a pool of reserve assets.This structure creates the same kinds of run incentives that we see in the traditional financial system. Stablecoin holders often have a “first-mover advantage” to redeem in times of stress – before conditions deteriorate further, fire sales become necessary, and the value of reserve holdings fall. As we saw in 2008 and 2020, runs and fire sales can spread like a contagion. A run on one stablecoin can lead to panicked runs on other stablecoins – causing even broader selloffs.Given these parallels, we have recommended that Congress enact legislation to establish a comprehensive prudential regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. Such a framework would include consolidated federal supervision, requirements for how a coin could be backed, capital and liquidity requirements, and restrictions on affiliation with commercial companies.In addition to stablecoins, we must identify and fill gaps in existing authority for the oversight of other crypto-assets – including those identified in the FSOC digital assets report. We have existing consumer and investor protection standards in traditional financial markets. These same principles and protections should apply in markets for crypto-assets.Finally, we are also working to address risks specific to digital assets. This includes risks associated with vertical integration of crypto-trading platforms and lack of visibility into the operations of subsidiaries and other entities across these businesses. And we are also exploring broader policy issues around the future of money and payments – including the possibility of a central bank digital currency.I’d be remiss if I did not end by speaking about one of the most important short-term actions that Congress can take to safeguard our financial stability: to raise or suspend the debt limit.Since 1789, the United States has paid all of our bills on time. It should stay that way. In my assessment – and that of economists across the board – a default on our obligations would cause an economic and financial catastrophe. No financial system is designed or regulated to be prepared for its own government to choose not to pay its bills. A breach of the debt ceiling could lead to a prolonged downturn and a global financial crisis. And it could upend the lives of millions of Americans and those around the world.19This catastrophe is preventable. Congress must raise or suspend the debt limit. It should do so without conditions – and without waiting until the last minute.Financial stability is a public good. Government plays a fundamental role in the provision of financial stability, as the costs of systemic failure are externalized to the broader society.At Treasury, we take this responsibility very seriously. Today, I’ve touched on select areas of our work. But our financial stability efforts extend to areas from cybersecurity to climate-related financial risks.As we chart a path forward, let me reflect on the contributions of the economics profession to this endeavor. In one of his most famous passages from “The General Theory,” John Maynard Keynes wrote that “the ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.”There is perhaps no better testament to this sentiment than the emergence of the field of financial stability. Early economists who studied systemic risk informed the views of the first responders – those who remarkably stopped a financial meltdown mid-stream in the fall of 2008. In 2020, financial regulators in the U.S. and around the world leaned on post-crisis reforms and intervened decisively to avoid a similar meltdown. Their work was made possible by the explosion of research in this area over the preceding decade.We should celebrate these developments as a collective contribution of our economics profession – just as the Keynesian explanation for recessions and depressions was an accomplishment of our profession in the mid-20th century. It is time to continue this work anew.My pledge to you is that I will continue to lead on the crucial work of financial stability at Treasury. And I hope you will be our partners as we continue to build a financial system that works for the American people."
155,,"March 29, 2023","Good afternoon, everyone. I’m glad to be with you today. I want to first welcome John as chair of the Federal Advisory Committee on Insurance. Let me also thank Dan for his tremendous service as this Committee’s past chair. 
 For over a decade, the Federal Insurance Office – FIO has been critical to monitoring and assessing the financial health of the insurance industry. A broad and diverse set of outside perspectives is important to any endeavor we undertake here at Treasury. But it is particularly important for FIO’s broad statutory mandate. This office is in charge of monitoring an industry with over $2.5 trillion in written premiums, over $11 trillion in total assets, and thousands of licensed insurers – and one that provides services and products that are crucial for households and businesses. Over the years, FIO has benefited from your expertise in areas from pandemic preparedness to protecting Americans’ retirement security to international market access. 
 You have also been indispensable in providing advice on one of FIO’s main priorities this year: improving our understanding of climate-related financial risks in the insurance industry.
 The Financial Stability Oversight Council identified climate change as an emerging threat to U.S. financial stability in October 2021. Climate change poses various risks to our financial system. A major one is physical risk: the harm to people and property that arises from acute disaster events like hurricanes, floods, and wildfires – as well as more chronic phenomena like warming temperatures. We’ve already seen an acceleration of these physical risks in the United States. There’s been at least a five-fold increase in the annual number of billion-dollar disasters in the past five years as compared to the 1980s – even after adjusting for inflation. Notably, in 2022, Hurricane Ian caused at least 157 deaths and almost $100 billion in damages. 
 There is growing evidence that these trends in physical risks have led to a decline in the availability and affordability of insurance in certain areas. We’ve seen insurers in states like California, Florida, and Louisiana raise rates or pull back from high-risk areas in response to rising insured losses. And we know that insurance may be especially difficult to find in traditionally underserved communities. According to one source, in 2022, insurance covered only 60 percent of $165 billion in total economic losses from climate-related disasters. This “protection gap” may indicate that Americans are facing challenges in finding available and affordable insurance in their area. This can have significant consequences for homeowners and the values of their assets. In turn, these developments can have cascading effects on the financial system. 
 In October 2022, FIO issued a proposed data collection from certain property and casualty insurers on their current and historical underwriting data on homeowner’s insurance. The aim is to gather consistent and granular data – down to the zip code level – that can help provide a nationwide understanding of the availability and affordability of insurance. It will help us assess how insurance coverage is being affected by climate-related risks. This would be the first-ever quantitative assessment of its kind. 
 This data collection would build on the other steps that FIO has taken in the past 18 months to bolster its climate work. That includes ramping up its engagement with the insurance sector domestically and internationally. It also includes producing an upcoming report that will focus on assessing climate-related issues or gaps in the supervision and regulation of insurers. 
 FIO has benefited greatly from this Committee’s significant expertise – particularly that of the Climate-Related Financial Risk Subcommittee. And we will continue to do so. We know that many stakeholders have submitted public comments in response to FIO’s proposed data collection. We look forward to continued engagement with stakeholders, as well as this Committee, as we advance this work.  
 I want to end by thanking you again for your service. Not only on climate-related work, but across all of FIO’s priorities. The work that you are doing as part of this Committee is crucial to bolstering the health of the U.S. financial system.

WASHINGTON – Today, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s second Summit for Democracy, Secretary Janet L. Yellen brought together leaders from government, civil society, and international organizations to discuss efforts to counter corruption and illicit finance in order to uphold the rule of law, promote good governance, and ensure an equal economic playing field. In late 2021, the United States announced its first-ever whole-of government strategy to counter corruption, and has been implementing the strategy throughout 2022 and 2023.

As part of Treasury’s anti-corruption work, the Secretary today announced the launch of a commitment by the United States and more than twenty foreign governments and authorities participating in the Summit to enhance beneficial ownership transparency. This commitment is in line with the revised FATF standard, which requires countries to improve the transparency of legal persons, like shell companies, and to prevent their misuse.

Remarks As Prepared for Delivery

Thank you very much for joining me here today at this important event. This week, leaders from democratic countries are gathering all across the world to discuss the threats democracies face and how to overcome them. 

As you know, corruption is among the most corrosive of those threats. Corruption erodes democracy and the rule of law. It hinders the business environment. It precludes essential government services from getting to the people who need it. And it exacerbates transnational challenges like migration, organized crime, extremism, and instability—threatening our national security. 

At the first Summit for Democracy in 2021, I described corruption as a “common adversary” for democracies everywhere. Since then, we have all witnessed the dangers and damage that this adversary has inflicted across the globe. 

Corruption has fueled the rise of kleptocratic regimes that are divorced from the interests of their own citizens. It has consolidated the power of autocrats to repress and harm opponents at home and abroad. Corruption allowed Vladimir Putin and Russian oligarchs to squander their nation’s wealth to fund their illegal war against Ukrainian civilians. Last month, I saw firsthand in Kyiv the tragic impact of Russia’s barbaric attacks. Corruption has also fueled political dysfunction in countries like Lebanon. It has subjected nations to cycles of deteriorating economic conditions. 

Democracies, including our own, are not immune. We know that corruption’s effects spill across borders. We have seen corrupt foreign officials bury stolen funds in U.S.-based shell companies; kleptocrats launder kickbacks through anonymous purchases of foreign real estate; and elites move corrupt proceeds through complicit or unwitting financial gatekeepers like attorneys or wealth managers. 

Therefore, countering corruption falls on all of us. We must rely on democratically elected governments to uphold high standards of transparency. On justice systems to defend the rule of law. On civil society and the press to shine light on wrongdoing and injustices. On the private sector to identify and report suspicious transactions. And, of course, on Finance Ministries like our very own Treasury Department to shape the economic and financial rules of the road to help prevent these crimes.

I’d like to focus today on what we are doing both at home and with partners across the world to tackle corruption. 

Domestic Efforts Let’s start domestically. The United States has a unique obligation to tackle corruption. Corrupt actors from around the world continually attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities in the U.S. framework—for countering money laundering, terrorist financing, and others forms of illicit finance. Fighting corruption depends on our ability to patch these weaknesses and bring light to the financial shadows.  
 
Just like legitimate investors, corrupt actors move their money through the United States to take advantage of the world’s largest and most dynamic economy. They incorporate companies to benefit from our strong legal system, buy assets like real estate, and invest in our deep and liquid markets. We’ve long known this. But our efforts with allies over the last year to track sanctioned Russian assets and restrict the access of sanctioned Russians to the international financial system have underscored our vulnerability.
 
Over the last few years, the Treasury Department has been hard at work building key infrastructure to fortify our financial system—and those investments will soon begin to pay off.
 
By this time next year, it will be more difficult for corrupt and criminal actors to hide their identities and wealth behind anonymous shell companies in the United States. Starting January 1, 2024, many companies formed or operating in the United States will be required to report information about their beneficial owners—that is, the real people who own or control a company.  
 
Unmasking shell corporations is the single most significant thing we can do to make our financial system inhospitable to corrupt actors. I said at the first Summit for Democracy that “there’s a good argument that, right now, the best place to hide and launder ill-gotten gains is actually the United States.” The beneficial ownership database will deter dirty money from entering the U.S. —and give law enforcement and other partners the tools they need to follow the money when it does.
 
Treasury has a lot of work to do to realize this promise – including by advancing additional rulemakings that need to be calibrated carefully. The database must be highly useful to all of its stakeholders. It must also ensure that firms—some of them very small businesses—understand their obligations. Reaching millions of small businesses is no small feat, and it is crucial to the success of the beneficial ownership system. Standing up this system will require the partnership and focus of all those who have been championing this initiative for decades – and many more.
 
In addition, Treasury is working to address additional vulnerabilities in our anti-money laundering infrastructure. We’re putting a particular focus on excluding corrupt actors from investing in, profiting from, and laundering money through investment firms as well as through purchases of U.S. real estate.
 
Corrupt actors have for decades anonymously stashed their ill-gotten gains in real estate. Those looking to exploit our system have been able to—with anonymity—store illicit proceeds in an appreciating asset. Buyers can pay in cash. By one estimate, illicit actors laundered at least $2.3 billion through U.S. real estate between 2015 and 2020. And the real number is almost certainly much higher. Treasury is working to remove that anonymity – and capture information about residential and commercial transactions not covered by our Bank Secrecy Act or beneficial ownership regimes. 
 
My team is looking at how to close off these avenues of money laundering without imposing an undue burden on legitimate transactions.

International Efforts

These domestic efforts go hand-in-hand with our work to fight corruption around the world. Beyond our bilateral efforts with individual countries, we are strengthening the global anti-corruption architecture. Without a strong and unified global approach, corrupt actors will continue to exploit financial loopholes and lightly regulated jurisdictions. 

We’re particularly focused on raising international standards for anti-money laundering at forums like the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF. 

In October, the FATF agreed to undertake three major projects to enhance global anti-corruption efforts. First, it will enhance assessments of countries’ implementation of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption. Second, it is addressing the use of “golden passports” by corrupt actors to hide their activities through the use of new identity documents. And third, it is working to reduce the ability of corrupt actors to take advantage of financial gatekeeping professions across all jurisdictions. Together, these initiatives place pressure on countries to strengthen anti-corruption regimes and mitigate vulnerabilities that corrupt actors too often exploit. 

We’re grateful for the FATF’s continued work to deepen international cooperation and support the rule of law. We commend its historic decision last month to suspend Russia’s membership. Russia has continued to disregard sovereignty, undertake inhumane attacks on Ukraine, and function as a haven for illicit finance. 

I am also pleased to launch today a commitment by the United States and more than twenty foreign governments and authorities participating in this summit to enhance beneficial ownership transparency. This commitment is in line with the revised FATF standard, which requires countries to improve the transparency of legal persons, like shell companies, and to prevent their misuse. And it reaffirms the broad support that the United States and its democratic partners share for enhancing financial transparency, fighting corruption, and upholding the rule of law. I look forward to more partners joining this important commitment following this summit.

The United States is building new international anti-corruption arrangements. Last year, President Biden and leaders from a dozen countries announced the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity. One of the key pillars of this Framework is building a “fair economy.” We are securing commitments to enact and enforce anti-money laundering and anti-bribery regimes in pursuit of that goal. 

Across all of these efforts, the private sector and civil society remain vital partners. I’m glad to see so many of you in the room today. I want to specifically highlight the Financial Transparency and Integrity Cohort, which was launched at the first Summit. This cohort has brought together a broad range of stakeholders to consult and coordinate on anti-corruption issues. 

Put simply, countering corruption is a collective effort that requires us to play by and enforce a common set of rules. We should use all of our tools, including the international financial institutions, to help those dedicated to rooting out financial crimes and to identify where countries are not yet taking appropriate steps. We can and must advance an architecture that safeguards our societies and our financial systems from abuse. 

Conclusion

Fighting corruption is not just the right thing to do. It is an essential piece of the puzzle as we work to build an economy that upholds a consistent set of rules for everyone—from government officials to business owners to working-class families. When those in power are able to pursue kickbacks, rig contracts, or enrich their friends, all of us suffer. Democracy suffers.

I’m confident that we can work to build a level playing field. This is our responsibility as democracies: to forge a world in which free institutions can thrive and in which those who play by the rules have the best chances of success. 

I’m grateful for everyone’s efforts here in pursuit of that goal. And I look forward to working with our many partners at this Summit to continue to turn that idea into a reality.

Thank you very much. "
157,,"March 21, 2023","WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen released the following statement on the staff-level agreement between Ukraine and the IMF for a new economic program.“I welcome the announcement by the International Monetary Fund that it has reached a staff-level agreement with Ukraine on a 4-year Extended Fund Facility program for $15.6 billion. An ambitious and appropriately conditioned IMF program is critical to underpin Ukraine’s reform efforts, including to strengthen good governance and address risks of corruption, and provide much needed financial support. It will also bolster the economic assistance that the United States and our partners have provided that is funding essential services like schools, hospitals, and first responders, and which is offering vital support to the Ukrainian economy. This agreement is an important step towards a program and reflects months of collaborative work between the IMF and Ukrainian government, supported by Treasury and other partners of Ukraine. The United States will stand with the government and the people of Ukraine for as long as it takes in the face of Russia’s unjust, unlawful, and immoral war."""
158,,"March 21, 2023","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Rob, for your leadership of the American Bankers Association. I greatly appreciate the invitation to be with all of you at an important moment.As everyone in this room knows, the American economy relies on a healthy banking system that can provide for the credit needs of families and businesses. American households depend on banks to finance their homes, invest in an education, and otherwise improve their standards of living. Businesses borrow from these institutions to start new companies and expand existing ones.Almost two weeks ago, we learned of problems at two banks that could have had significant impacts on the broader banking system and the economy. The situation demanded a swift response. In the days that followed, the federal government delivered just that: decisive and forceful actions to strengthen public confidence in the U.S. banking system and protect the American economy.Let me be clear: the government’s recent actions have demonstrated our resolute commitment to take the necessary steps to ensure that depositors’ savings and the banking system remain safe.First, we worked with the Federal Reserve and FDIC to protect all depositors in the resolutions of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The steps we took were not focused on aiding specific banks or classes of banks. Our intervention was necessary to protect the broader U.S. banking system. And similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion. I believe that our actions reduced the risk of further bank failures that would have imposed losses on the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is paid for through fees on insured banks.Second, we announced a new facility to provide additional liquidity to the banking system. The Fed’s new lending facility – the Bank Term Funding Program – is designed to help banks meet the needs of all of their depositors.The situation is stabilizing. And the U.S. banking system remains sound. The Fed facility and discount window lending are working as intended to provide liquidity to the banking system. Aggregate deposit outflows from regional banks have stabilized.As you know, 11 banks – including the very largest and some regional banks – announced $30 billion in deposits into First Republic Bank last week. This support represents a vote of confidence in our banking system.We are continuing to monitor conditions closely. My team and I have been in close communication with many of you, in addition to federal and state regulators, other market participants, and international counterparts.While we don’t yet have all the details about the collapse of the two banks, we do know that the recent developments are very different than those of the Global Financial Crisis. Back then, many financial institutions came under stress due to their holdings of subprime assets. We do not see that situation in the banking system today. Our financial system is also significantly stronger than it was 15 years ago. This is in large part due to post-crisis reforms that provided stronger capital standards, among other important improvements.In the coming weeks, it will be vital for us to get a full accounting of exactly what happened in these bank failures. Regulators have already announced a review into Silicon Valley Bank. We are currently focused on the situation at hand. But we will need to reexamine our current regulatory and supervisory regimes and consider whether they are appropriate for the risks that banks face today. We all share an interest in ensuring that the United States remains the strongest and safest financial system in the world.Given recent developments, I think it is important to reaffirm a broader point: our dynamic and diverse banking system is critical to the American economy. Large banks play an important role in our economy, but so do small- and mid-sized banks. These banks are heavily engaged in traditional banking services that provide vital credit and financial support to families and small businesses. They also increase competition in the banking sector, and often have specialized knowledge and expertise in the communities they invest in.Indeed, many of these banks have played an important role in supporting our economic recovery. In the depths of the pandemic, Treasury was tasked with getting money quickly and responsibly to those who needed it. So, we worked closely with many of you to send economic impact payments to millions of families. You’ve also worked with us to deliver advance payments from the enhanced Child Tax Credit – which helped cut child poverty nearly in half in 2021. And we’ve collaborated to rapidly deploy assistance to hundreds of thousands of homeowners facing foreclosure. I also know that many of you are working with state governments to inject new financing into small businesses as part of our State Small Business Credit Initiative. In the prior iteration of this program, lenders with less than $10 billion in assets accounted for 95 percent of all program-supported loans. Our Administration has also been focused on working with mission-oriented banks to put us on a path toward inclusive economic growth. For example, Treasury’s Emergency Capital Investment Program has invested almost $8.4 billion in depository institutions that are CDFIs and MDIs.To end, let me return to where I started. A safe and sound banking system is integral to the health of the American economy. We are squarely focused on doing our job. And you should rest assured that we will remain vigilant."
159,,"February 27, 2023","As we mark one year since the beginning of this full-scale invasion, the message I bring to you from President Biden is simple: America will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.From the early days of the war, we have been proud to support Ukraine’s resistance as its largest bilateral donor.  To date, the United States has provided close to $50 billion in security, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine.The U.S. has provided over $14 billion in economic assistance. In the coming months, we will provide an additional over $8 billion in economic support.Your steady hand and prudent economic management in the face of tremendous economic challenges has made a meaningful impact in helping stabilize Ukraine’s economy.We both know that effective military resistance on the front lines of this fight requires a functioning economy and government, and continued essential public services like education, hospitals, and emergency response.We commend your ongoing focus on the importance of fighting corruption and President Zelenskyy’s goal of strengthening accountability and good governance. And we believe that President Zelenskyy’s commitment to make sure that international assistance is being used responsibly is essential.Looking ahead, we know that Ukraine’s process of rebuilding its economy following its victory is critical to its long-term future. That’s why we’ve been strong supporters of the Multi-agency Donor Coordination Platform for Ukraine.  The U.S. will remain by your side at every step of the way."

161,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here.

162,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

164,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
165,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

166,,"February 27, 2023","I am honored to gather with you today. St. Michael’s Square reminds us of the deep history of this city – a history tracing back around 1,500 years. And yet we are also reminded today that the future is not preordained. People who stand up with courage have the capacity to shape the course of history.Over the past year, Ukraine has been writing the next chapter of its history – with its heroic fight for freedom. Today, I am witnessing firsthand the devastating toll of Putin’s brutal war. I know that what I’m seeing here in Kyiv reflects just a small fraction of the hardship that Ukrainians have faced over the past year. Thousands of innocent civilians have been killed; so many more livelihoods shattered.And yet, Ukraine still stands strong. The Ukrainian resistance has inspired millions of people across the globe. In the face of trying circumstances, the Ukrainian military has fought valiantly in defense of the Ukrainian homeland and the universal principles of freedom and dignity. More broadly, the Ukrainian people’s strength and resilience have captivated the globe. Ukraine’s blue-and-yellow flag hangs down the hall from my office at the Treasury Department in Washington. That is only one example of how Ukraine’s fight for justice has inspired the world.We have pledged to do our part to support the Ukrainian people. Not only with words, but with actions. We will continue to work with our international coalition to provide military, economic, and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. And we will continue to impose severe costs on the Kremlin for its illegal war. As President Biden has said, we will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes.Ukrainian courage takes different forms. Last December, during Russia’s brutal assault, you lit a Christmas tree in the middle of Old Kyiv, just a few hundred feet away. It had not been planned. But as Kyiv’s mayor said, “we wouldn’t let Russia steal the celebration…from our children.” You called this tree – “the Tree of Invincibility.”History will note the brutality of this war. It will also remember the heroes – some sung and many more unsung – who fought for human dignity, self-determination, and freedom in Ukraine’s darkest hour. It is an honor for me to stand with the people of Ukraine in this fight."
167,,"February 27, 2023","The strength of the Ukrainian military. The resilience of Ukraine’s government. The courage of the people of Ukraine. Faced with a brutal and unprovoked invasion, you are standing strong.One year ago, some believed that Russia would secure a quick and decisive victory over Kyiv. Russian forces had advanced within sight of this very school. But today, Ukraine still stands. The victory that Putin expected has turned into a strategic failure. Putin’s troops have faced defeats on the battlefield. The Russian economy is weaker and more isolated. And NATO and our global coalition stand united behind Ukraine.The foundation of Ukraine’s successful resistance has been the remarkable resolve and resilience of the Ukrainian people. We see that here at this school – where students and teachers came together to resist the Russian advance.I know that this fight has come at great cost to all of you. Many of you have lost family members and close friends. Across Kyiv and Ukraine, we see evidence of the brutality of Putin’s military. The bombing of hospitals. The destruction of cultural sites. Deliberate attacks on civilian energy grids designed to cause widespread suffering in the middle of winter.But you have fought on despite it all. As you do, I want you to know this: you are not alone. We are with you. The United States has your back – and we will stand with you for as long as it takes.From the start, we have been proud to support you. Not only with words, but with actions. We have a basic moral duty to stand by you in your darkest hour. But as President Zelenskyy has said, our support is not “charity.” It’s an investment in “global security and democracy.” It is in our vital interests to see a free and stable Europe. And it is critical that we deter any other would-be aggressors who may be emboldened to otherwise seize territory.Today, I’d like to focus on the importance of two pillars of our support for Ukraine. First, we are providing direct assistance that is critical for Ukraine’s resistance – including economic support to shore up its government and economy. And second, we are leading an unprecedented multilateral sanctions coalition to impose severe economic costs on Russia for its war.The United States is proud to be Ukraine’s largest bilateral donor. Over the past year, we have provided close to $50 billion in security, economic, and humanitarian assistance. We’re also proud to be joined by an international coalition of partners, including the European Union and other members of the G7.Much of the public focus has been on the critical security support we are providing for Ukraine’s brave military: tanks, air defense systems, ammunition, and more. But my visit to Kyiv today underscores the importance of our economic support.The United States has provided $13 billion in economic assistance to Ukraine. Today, I am proud to announce the transfer of an additional amount of over $1.2 billion. That’s the first tranche of about $10 billion in direct budget support that the United States will provide in the coming months.Our economic support is helping keep the Ukrainian government and critical service providers operational under extraordinary circumstances. Just as security assistance bolsters the front lines, I believe that this economic assistance is fortifying the home front – thereby strengthening Ukraine’s resistance.First, our funds are helping keep government civil servants on the job. Ukraine’s military successes are first and foremost the product of the bravery and skill of Ukrainian soldiers. But a sustained military effort cannot succeed without an effective government at home. The Ukrainian government serves as a bedrock of stability for the nation at a time of war. Maintaining an effective government is indispensable to Ukraine’s capacity to respond to Russian attacks and other emergencies.Second, our economic support is keeping essential public services running. These services help maintain economic and social stability for Ukrainians. They help mitigate the emergence of an even greater humanitarian crisis. Our funds help pay for emergency personnel: from firefighters who answer the call when missiles strike to medical professionals who treat sick and wounded civilians. They help fund teachers – at this school and many others – so they can continue to educate Ukraine’s youth. Our assistance also helps provide aid to Ukrainians who are bearing the biggest brunt of the war, such as those internally displaced.Third, we are working with our partners through the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to keep basic infrastructure and supply chains working. A functioning Ukrainian economy is vital to its ability to finance a robust defense effort. We are providing access to working capital for businesses in critical sectors like agriculture, energy, and transportation. For example, our funds are helping repair civilian power grids damaged by Russia’s barbaric missile strikes. They also enable the continued export of grain.We welcome President Zelenskyy’s ardent commitment to handling these funds in the “most responsible way.” Our delivery partners at the World Bank have instituted robust safeguards for transparency and accountability. And the U.S. government has deployed independent, third-party monitors to bolster oversight. Even before the war, President Zelenskyy pursued an agenda to strengthen good governance. We share his recognition that these standards are just as important in wartime as in peacetime. These standards enable vital assistance to reach people in need. They bolster Ukraine’s European Union ambitions. Transparency and accountability will become even more important as Ukraine rebuilds its infrastructure and recovers from the impacts of the war. As the U.S. continues to support Ukraine economically, we will press for more action by our allies and partners. We expect to see the IMF move speedily toward establishing an ambitious and fully financed program. And we are ready to support Ukraine in making sure this happens in a timely way. We are also committed to supporting Ukraine in its eventual reconstruction effort. In preparation, Ukraine, the United States, the European Commission, and the rest of the G7 have established an inclusive platform to mobilize donors from across the globe and coordinate assistance flows.As heroic Ukrainian soldiers repel Russian attacks, we are also leading a multilateral coalition to impose heavy costs on Russia for its barbaric war. We have one objective: to help end Russia’s war. Toward this aim, our coalition of over 30 countries has mounted the swiftest, most unified, and most ambitious sanctions regime in modern history.We have taken coordinated actions to degrade Russia’s military-industrial complex and deny Russia the revenue to fund its war. We are systematically disrupting Russia’s military supply chains. This is making it harder for Russia to replace the over 9,000 military vehicles, artillery, and other pieces of equipment it has lost on the battlefield. We are going after Iranian drone companies and facilitators that have supplied weapons to Russia. We have also enacted export controls to restrict Russia’s access to cutting-edge technology. These measures are particularly powerful because the U.S. and our allies are the main producers – or in some cases, the only producers – of many critical military inputs. In the past year, Russia has suffered production shutdowns at key defense-industrial facilities. And it’s struggling amid shortages of inputs for tanks, aircraft, and submarines. The United States and our partners have also taken a range of innovative actions to reduce the revenues that the Kremlin can use to fund its war. We have cut off major parts of the Russian financial system from the global economy. Our coalition has also immobilized vast central bank reserves that Russia was counting on to fuel its war effort. We have implemented price caps on Russian seaborne exports of crude oil and refined products. These caps have helped drive Russian government oil revenues nearly 60 percent lower last month than they were immediately after the invasion.As you saw with our new actions last week, we will not rest until the war ends. A central piece of our strategy in 2023 will be to disrupt Russia’s attempts to evade our sanctions. We will improve coordination with our allies. We will target dual-use inputs that Russia has been repurposing for its war effort. And we will raise the pressure on companies and jurisdictions that are backfilling or facilitating sanctions evasion. Let me be clear: the United States will not hesitate to use our authorities to disrupt entities that help the Kremlin evade our sanctions.Ukraine has now entered the second year of a full-scale war it did not choose. It is engaged in a battle – not to dominate, but to defend. To defend not only Ukrainian lives and territory – but freedom and the free world itself.The great Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko once wrote: “the history of my life is a part of the history of my homeland.” That was true in 1991, 2004, and 2014. It is especially true now. The grief of Bucha, the resistance in Mariupol, and the counteroffensives in Kherson and Kharkiv – I know these are events seared into your and your nation’s consciousness. I am honored to stand in Kyiv today with you. There will be difficult days ahead. Many of you have endured more suffering in the past year than most people do in their entire lifetimes. And yet, you have told me that what you’ve been through only hardens your resolve.Just as your life is a part of the history of Ukraine – I believe that Ukraine is a central part of the history of the free world. And you are writing our history right now. As you do, I hope you know this: America stands with you in this fight for freedom. And we will be by your side to help you rebuild."
168,,"February 27, 2023","President Zelenskyy, thank you for your warm welcome.  Thank you for the leadership you have shown the world since the beginning of this illegal and unprovoked war.Ukraine’s fight is our fight – for our shared values of democracy, the right to self-determination, and for an international order that advances peace and prosperity.We are matching our words with actions. The U.S. is proud to be Ukraine’s largest bilateral donor. To date, the United States has provided close to $50 billion in assistance to Ukraine.To date, we have provided over $14 billion in economic assistance. In the coming months, we will disburse an additional over $8 billion in economic support.We are committed to providing you with the security assistance you need to defend your country. But we also know that resistance on the frontlines isn’t possible without a strong and stable home front: an economy that functions, and a government that continues to provide vital services."
169,,"February 25, 2023","As Prepared for Delivery 
Thank you very much for joining me. One of the most rewarding parts of my job is meeting with innovators, entrepreneurs, and business leaders across the globe.

That is especially true in India, which has one of the most dynamic economies in the world.
As President Biden has said, India is an indispensable partner to the United States. I was able to see the strength of our economic ties firsthand in November when I visited Delhi for the U.S.-India Economic and Financial Partnership. And I’m glad to be back in India to build on my previous trip.

The U.S. is India’s biggest trading partner. In 2021, our bilateral trade was over $150 billion. Our people-to-people ties affirm the closeness of our relationship. 200,000 Indians are studying in America and enriching our schools and universities. We depend on each other on a daily basis: Indians use WhatsApp to communicate and many American companies rely on Infosys to operate.

As we look towards the future, I am eager to deepen our ties in the technology sector. The United States is advancing an approach called “friendshoring” to bolster the resilience of our supply chains. We are doing this by strengthening integration with our many trusted trading partners – including India. We are seeing progress; as an example, technology companies like Apple and Google have expanded their phone production in India.

Through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII, we are investing in digital technologies that will drive inclusive, resilient growth in India. Under PGII, the United States has announced investments in agri-tech to enable climate-smart agricultural production, and in digital payments systems for microentrepreneurs. These stand alongside investments in renewable energy, health, and other infrastructure sectors in India. Overall, the United States aims to mobilize $200 billion through 2027 for PGII, and we look forward to partnering with India to continue investing in its future.

I look forward to discussing ways to deepen our countries’ economic integration – and more – with you today."
170,,"February 24, 2023","WASHINGTON – Today, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the international standard-setting body on illicit finance, suspended the Russian Federation from its membership. This is the first time in the FATF’s 34-year history that the body has taken such unprecedented action, a step warranted by Russia’s unlawful, immoral, and unprovoked war against Ukraine.FATF members lead the global effort on combatting money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation and members are expected to uphold and promote core principles that safeguard the global financial system.  Russia’s ongoing war undermines the principles of international cooperation and mutual respect that underpin the mandate of the FATF.In its public statement, the FATF expressed growing concern over reports of arms trade by Russia with United Nations sanctioned countries and malicious cyber-activities emanating from Russia. The FATF advises that jurisdictions remain vigilant of threats to their financial system arising from Russia’s war against Ukraine.“The United States commends the FATF’s historic decision to suspend Russia’s membership in the body,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Russia’s disregard for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine is at odds with the FATF’s foundational values of international cooperation and the rule of law. Further, Russia’s dealings with suppliers of last resort such as Iran and North Korea, its government-driven efforts to evade international sanctions and export controls, and other activities like harboring cybercriminals or the Wagner Group make it a haven for illicit finance – the very thing the FATF works to combat.”At this week’s plenary, the FATF also approved an updated standard on legal arrangements such as trusts as well as new guidance on beneficial ownership transparency of companies to stop their misuse by criminals. The FATF adopted its first-ever report on ransomware that urges countries to take immediate steps to identify and disrupt ransomware finance and to implement the FATF standards for virtual assets as soon as possible. In addition, the FATF adopted the Mutual Evaluation Reports of Indonesia and Qatar. "
171,,"February 24, 2023","We are continuing to impose significant costs on Russia for its illegal war against Ukraine, including through additional sanctions measures. Our global coalition is working relentlessly to disrupt Russian military supply chains, limit the Kremlin’s revenue, and make it harder for them to use the money they have to source military equipment from abroad.In the year ahead, we’ll redouble our efforts at disrupting Russian sanctions evasion efforts. That includes by sharing intelligence, identifying and eliminating specific networks, and making it harder for companies and jurisdictions to serve as evasion channels.Our work together also includes the price cap on Russian crude oil and refined products.  While it is still early, we are seeing progress towards its twin goals of reducing Russian revenue and promoting stability in global oil markets.We are also collaborating closely to support Ukraine, including through bilateral and multilateral economic support that is bolstering the Ukrainian home front and their valiant resistance on the battlefield.  We are engaging with other G20 members to support developing and emerging economies impacted by Russia’s war, evolve the multilateral development bank system, and address debt challenges. "

He has the right leadership and management skills, experience living and working in emerging markets, and financial expertise to lead the World Bank at a critical moment in its history, deliver on its core development goals, and evolve the Bank to meet global challenges like climate change.As a renowned executive, Mr. Banga has led a global organization with nearly 20,000 employees, advocated for diversity and inclusion, and delivered results. His efforts have helped bring 500 million unbanked people into the digital economy, deploy private capital into climate solutions, and expand economic opportunity through the Partnership for Central America.This experience will help him achieve the World Bank’s objectives of eliminating extreme poverty and expanding shared prosperity while pursuing the changes needed to effectively evolve the institution to be fit for purpose for the world we face today. Ajay Banga understands that those core objectives are deeply intertwined with challenges like meeting ambitious goals for climate adaptation and emissions reduction, preparing for and preventing future pandemics, and mitigating the root causes and consequences of conflict and fragility.While the World Bank will continue to play a key role in improving the lives of people around the globe, it can’t do it alone. Mr. Banga’s track record of forging partnerships between the public sector, private sector, and non-profits uniquely equips him to help mobilize the private capital and press for the reforms needed to meet our shared ambitions. In doing so, the World Bank can serve as a force multiplier for good by setting the right agenda and catalyzing action from across the spectrum – including governments, the private sector, other multilateral development banks, civil society and philanthropies.”"
173,,"February 15, 2023","“I thank David Malpass for his service as President of the World Bank and for his commitment to ensuring a smooth transition. Under President Malpass’ leadership, the World Bank has advanced shared priorities that have measurably improved the lives of people around the globe. The world has benefitted from his strong support for Ukraine in the face of Russia’s illegal and unprovoked invasion, his vital work to assist the Afghan people, and his commitment to helping low-income countries achieve debt sustainability through debt reduction.  And while we all must continue to raise our collective ambitions in the fight against climate change, during President Malpass’ tenure the World Bank has made important recent advances in this area, including through the successful launch of the Country Climate Diagnostic Reports. I appreciate his receptiveness to our goal and his preparation of a roadmap for evolving the multilateral development banks, and I look forward to continuing to work with him during this transition.The United States looks forward to the Executive Board running a transparent, merit-based and swift nomination process for the next World Bank President. We will put forward a candidate to lead the World Bank and build on the Bank’s longstanding work to fight extreme poverty, promote shared prosperity, and who will carry forward the vital work we are undertaking to evolve the multilateral development banks to better meet the challenges of the 21st century. That includes by expanding our capacity to combat climate change, improve public health, and address conflict and fragility in the pursuit of ending poverty and advancing prosperity.” "
174,,"February 14, 2023","Thank you for that introduction. It’s a privilege to be here with so many great county leaders. Many jobs in public service are difficult. But there are very few jobs where you are more tested on your ability to deliver — day in and day out — than leading a local government. That’s certainly been true over the past three years. So, thank you for your tireless work.I also want to thank NACo for its strong partnership. We have worked hand-in-hand at every step of our recovery over the past two years. President Winfrey, thank you for your leadership — both at NACo and Will County. Thank you to Past President Johnson. I’m also grateful to Matt Chase and the whole NACo team for their stewardship of this organization. Without the voices of our counties, the American Rescue Plan would have undoubtedly looked quite different. As a result, our recovery would have looked quite different, too.Two years ago, I spoke to local leaders ahead of the passage of the Rescue Plan. My hope, I said, was that the law would “finally allow us to do what most of us came to government for — not simply to fight fires and resolve crises, but to build a better country.” Today, I can unequivocally say that we have done just that. The Rescue Plan provided critical relief and helped drive a historic recovery. Just as importantly, it has strengthened the future of our counties and our country.Specifically, the Rescue Plan has been transformative in tackling some of the persistent challenges facing our counties — from child poverty to housing security. And it has set the stage for the passage and successful implementation of our Administration’s historic long-term investments. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act will position us for economic success in the coming decades.Let me first take us back two years ago — when the Rescue Plan was still being debated in the halls of Congress. Our country was in the middle of a public health crisis. We were losing more American lives a week to the virus than at any other point since the pandemic began. And the public health catastrophe had triggered an economic calamity. Millions of jobs had been lost. More Americans were applying for unemployment insurance each week than during the worst week of the Great Recession. And all of us were haunted by the fresh memories of Americans in long lines outside of food banks and unemployment offices. I’m sure you remember this vividly — because many of you were there, helping your residents.You also knew of the growing crisis facing your governments during the pandemic. Counties across the country vary in their needs. But they play a major role in providing critical services to Americans — from managing public health and safety to maintaining public infrastructure. In mid-2020, over 70 percent of counties were estimated to had cut or delayed capital investments. And over two-thirds had cut or delayed their county services. In other words, you were facing the profound challenge of responding to a once-in-a-century crisis with very few resources.Then, thanks to our joint effort, came the American Rescue Plan and our vaccination campaign. The Rescue Plan initiated bold and timely action — delivered at a moment when we faced grave uncertainty about the direction of our economy. We knew it was important to provide direct and flexible aid to state and local governments. Critically, we had to avoid the mistakes of the Great Recession, when state and local austerity was a drag on GDP growth for the first 14 quarters of the recovery. So, we did what had never been done at this scale: deliver relief to over 3,000 counties in the United States. We also provided our recipients with sustained and flexible funding. It was clear that this crisis would evolve with new variants, and that it would affect each jurisdiction differently. A one-size-fits-all approach would not have sufficed.Our plan worked. Our economic recovery has been one of the strongest in modern history. The past two years have seen the largest jobs gains on record. We’ve also seen the creation of 10 million new businesses. That’s the strongest two years in history. And real GDP per capita is at an all-time high. Our recovery has also been historically inclusive. The unemployment rate has been near record lows for Black and Hispanic Americans. And it reached an all-time low for people with disabilities in December. Of course, we still face significant global headwinds. But the American economy is more resilient today because of our robust recovery.Importantly, we placed a deliberate focus on preventing the “scarring” that we’ve seen in past recessions. The Great Recession cast a long shadow on the 2010s. In that crisis, the long-term unemployment rate — the share of those long-term unemployed among all unemployed — peaked in April 2010 and never fully recovered for the rest of the decade. This time, the rate returned to pre-pandemic levels less than a year and a half after its peak. Our recovery saved many Americans from long-term unemployment — a crippling fate that results in severe financial stress on those out of work and their families.And thanks to you, our counties have returned to normal operations. Soon after the Rescue Plan’s passage, we saw state and local governments cancelling planned layoffs and furloughs of their workers. Many have gone further and invested in new staff with Rescue Plan dollars. We have also provided additional revenue support to counties with federal public lands — about two-thirds of all counties in the United States. Some of these counties have long suffered from inconsistent receipts. Typically, the aftermath of recessions leaves more pain: more child poverty, more hunger, more housing instability. Not only did the Rescue Plan alleviate that pain — it also made bold progress on some of the greatest challenges we faced.Economists have long understood the importance of financial support for families with children. It’s associated with significant improvements in long-term health, higher school enrollment and graduation rates, and a reduction in poverty-related stress. Support was particularly vital in the middle of a pandemic, which had swept millions of households into poverty. So, the President signed into the law the most significant Child Tax Credit ever. This included monthly advance payments to more than 37 million households. Crucially, the Credit was fully refundable. This meant that lower-income families could reap its full benefits.The results were extraordinary — particularly when combined with our other policy interventions. In 2021, child poverty was cut nearly in half — to a record low of 5.2 percent.This was possible not only because of the law but because of its implementation. We disbursed payments automatically to those we could. For those we couldn’t, we made it simple for families to file a claim. Importantly, we relied on our counties to get the word out. And you did — ensuring that these benefits reached every single corner of America. As you heard from the President at the State of the Union last week, our Administration is fighting very hard to restore this enhanced Child Tax Credit.Just as we faced the prospect of a spike in child poverty, the pandemic also posed the very real possibility of a tsunami of evictions. So, our emergency rental assistance program did what had never been done before: it created the first nationwide infrastructure for eviction prevention. We delivered federal relief to millions of households across the country — through close partnership with states, localities, and organizations like NACo. Over 80 percent of that assistance has gone to very low-income households.But the legacy of our program extends far beyond the immediate lifeline it gave to renters. By our count, 180 jurisdictions across 36 states have now created or enhanced structures and policies for eviction prevention — much of which will last beyond the expiration of federal funds. Jurisdictions are taking their own actions to continue this work. Memphis and Shelby County, Tennessee are helping provide legal services to tenants facing evictions. They are also establishing a data-sharing relationship with the local court system with the goal of diverting potential evictions. Eviction Lab founder Matt Desmond has said that the Administration’s actions have “formed the most important federal housing policy in the last decade” and together represent “the most important eviction prevention policy in American history.”We advanced economic security for Americans in many other ways. One of the most underappreciated achievements of the Rescue Plan was securing pension benefits for millions of workers and retirees. Prior to the law, over 200 multiemployer pension plans were on pace to become insolvent. Millions of Americans were facing the very real threat that their benefits would get slashed. It’s a loss that would have permanently degraded the quality of their hard-earned retirement. But we intervened — ensuring that these workers will get the benefits that they worked so hard for.It’s also important to me to highlight how counties are taking on some of the greatest challenges facing their rural residents. In doing so, they are setting themselves up for new economic opportunities. Lewis and Clark County, Montana is expanding its water wells and upgrading its piping systems. This is helping ensure that its residents have more consistent access to drinking water. Walworth County, Wisconsin funded a public health mobile unit to provide COVID and other health services to its most underserved rural communities. We also know that mental health and substance use challenges too often devastate families in rural areas. So, we’ve seen counties from Idaho to New York use Rescue Plan dollars to pay for crisis hotlines, community response hubs, and sober living programs.By stabilizing our economy and tackling longstanding challenges, the Rescue Plan also laid the foundation for the passage of our Administration’s historic long-term investments — in infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, and clean energy.The Rescue Plan significantly improved the livelihoods of Americans as we recovered from the pandemic crisis. Rather than soaring long-term unemployment, we have the lowest unemployment rate in more than 50 years. Rather than widespread foreclosures and bankruptcies, American households have the funds to pay their bills. Rather than being forced into budget cuts and layoffs, local governments are able to provide services that their residents need to stay on their feet.In short, without the American Rescue Plan, our federal government would likely still be focused squarely on putting out the fire instead of rebuilding our house. And counties might still be struggling with restoring their operations to normal levels — rather than thinking about new investments that will shape the future of their economies. The strong recovery of the past two years has not only meant that Americans are better off today. It has allowed us to focus on what our economy will look like in 2030 — not just 2023. Indeed, we’ve heard from local officials that the Rescue Plan was a foundational policy that set the stage for the trifecta of legislation we are implementing now: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act.We know that laws don’t implement themselves. Turning a law into action requires close partnership between the federal government, state and local governments, workers and unions, businesses, and non-profits.Across the country, we are seeing the Rescue Plan contribute to ongoing implementation of these laws. It is helping counties develop their communities into the kinds of places that can create and attract the jobs of the future — whether the county is an urban center, in the suburbs, or in a rural area. I believe this is particularly important for counties that have remarkable promise but have suffered from disinvestment over the years.There are two priority areas where we’ve seen particularly transformative investments. We urge counties to continue to focus on these areas with their State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds.The first is workforce. Last summer, our Administration launched a Talent Pipeline Challenge to surge our workforce development efforts. The goal was to train a highly skilled, diverse workforce to implement the historic Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many state and local governments answered that call with Rescue Plan investments. Franklin County, Ohio is funding a pre-apprenticeship program to prepare workers for careers in the skilled construction trades.  Rescue Plan dollars are also being spent to train workers in innovative industries like semiconductor manufacturing. And many jurisdictions are supporting programs to increase labor-force participation. We’ve seen expansions of childcare facilities and new job training programs for underserved populations — like those experiencing homelessness or those formerly incarcerated.The second is affordable housing. Our suite of new legislation is creating new manufacturing hubs and economic centers across the country. As it does, it’s vital that workers are able to afford quality housing near their workplace. Yet, according to Moody’s, there is a shortfall of over 1.5 million homes in the United States. Our Administration is working with many of you to implement a Housing Supply Action Plan — which includes calling on Congress to take additional actions. The goal is to close the housing supply shortfall by 2027. As part of this Action Plan, we announced a series of steps that would make it easier for our recipients to use State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds for affordable housing construction and preservation. This includes permitting governments to use these funds to fully finance long-term affordable housing loans. Many counties have taken advantage of this flexibility. For example, New Hanover County, North Carolina has since announced progress in developing a 278-unit apartment complex. It’s scheduled to break ground this year.As of last year, governments have budgeted over $14 billion of State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds for over 1,800 projects focused on housing. And this is just the beginning.Looking forward, Treasury will continue to support jurisdictions as they make investments in these areas. I know our team — led by Chief Recovery Officer Jacob Leibenluft — is looking for opportunities to highlight your best practices.I’ve spoken today about what we’ve been able to achieve together through the Rescue Plan. But I’d be remiss if I did not speak about a pressing issue that could threaten all the progress that we’ve made over the past two years.As many of you know, I have asked Congress to raise or suspend the debt limit. Since 1789, the United States has paid all of our bills on time. It should stay that way. In my assessment — and that of economists across the board — a default on our debt would produce an economic and financial catastrophe. Many of your residents could ultimately lose their jobs. Household payments on mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards would rise, and American businesses would see credit markets deteriorate. On top of that, it is unlikely that the federal government would be able to issue payments to millions of Americans, including our military families and seniors who rely on Social Security. In the longer term, a default would raise the cost of borrowing into perpetuity. Future investments — including public investments — would become substantially more costly.This economic catastrophe is preventable. The solution is simple: Congress must vote to raise or suspend the debt limit. It should do so without conditions. And it should not wait until the last minute. I believe it is a basic responsibility of our nation’s leaders to get this done.Over the course of my career, the United States has endured several recessions. The origins and nature of these crises have varied. But the responses to all of them have required people of good will to work collaboratively, under tremendous pressure, to deliver decisively on behalf of the American people.Over the past few years, many of us have been in the trenches together. We’ve faced down a devastating public health crisis. We’ve rescued the American economy. And we are now investing in our future.None of this has been easy. Particularly for you — the county leaders of America. But the progress we’ve made is proof of what we can do when our counties and our federal government come together. Not only to fight fires, but to build a better world after the crisis.Of the many legacies that each of us will leave, this is one that all of us should be very proud of. I look forward to building on this legacy with you in the months and years to come."
175,,"February 9, 2023","Last fall, I issued an urgent call ahead of the World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings — for the evolution of the multilateral development bank system. My reasoning was simple: the world has changed, and we need these vital institutions to change along with it. In today’s world, it’s important that the MDBs make progress on their core mission of poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth. But it’s also important that they take decisive action on global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility. These goals are all essential, and they are closely linked.Since the aftermath of the Second World War, the development banks have played a critical role in alleviating poverty and spurring economic development. They’ve done so successfully for a broad range of countries, including those facing persistent poverty and those recovering from disaster and conflict. Last month, I visited three countries in Africa. I saw first-hand the impact of these banks’ direct financing of national development projects. Projects like these have connected millions to electricity and clean water. They’ve helped farmers get more crops to market. And they’ve funded the construction of modern roads and bridges.But even before the onset of the COVID pandemic, our tremendous progress on poverty reduction was beginning to lag. In today’s world, sustained progress on poverty alleviation and economic development is simply not possible without addressing the global challenges that face us all. The COVID pandemic, for example, led to a rise in extreme poverty for the first time in over 20 years. In Zambia, smallholder farmers told me that extreme weather events like droughts and floods have dampened agricultural yields – exacerbating hunger and food insecurity. Many African leaders have noted to me the impacts of conflict on their economic growth. These effects are not just local to countries in conflict. They spill over to neighboring countries.The costs and benefits of addressing global challenges are diffuse. They don’t all accrue to a single country. The MDBs’ core model involves countries borrowing to make specific investments aimed at addressing development constraints in their own countries. That model is insufficient to meet the moment. Such a model will always underinvest in addressing global challenges – since the benefits of investments in global challenges stretch far beyond the borders of the country where a given project takes place. The costs of failing to address these global challenges may be spread across the world. Nevertheless, these costs have a serious impact on national and local realities. They are very real for the people who face them. Many times, these are the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. That’s why I – along with other shareholders – called for an evolution of the development banks last fall. It’s time for these banks to address global challenges head on – with the urgency and scale that is required. We have begun the evolution of the World Bank. Next, we expect to take this agenda to the regional development banks.Let me speak specifically about our work on the World Bank. We are focused on evolving its vision, incentives, operating model, and financial capacity.First, the Bank needs to expand its vision to include addressing global challenges as an integral part of achieving its Twin Goals: poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Let me be clear: this does not mean shifting the Bank away from its traditional work. It means expanding the work of the Bank to better include addressing global challenges. These challenges are intertwined with alleviating poverty and supporting inclusive and sustainable development.Second, the Bank must create the right incentives for countries to tackle global challenges. That includes lowering investment costs to make these types of projects more economically viable. My view is that since the global community benefits from these investments, the global community should help bear their cost.For example, we are asking the Bank to identify concessional resources available to countries to tackle global challenges. These resources could incentivize the decommissioning of coal plants and protect displaced workers during a clean energy transition. They could enhance health systems to mitigate the spread of disease. Or they could support basic services for refugees and their host communities. The World Bank will also need to develop diagnostic tools to help countries understand how global challenges affect their development. This will help guide project and financing decisions.Third, the Bank must be bolder and more imaginative in its operational approach. For example, we know that sub-national entities can sometimes have greater expertise and willingness to implement innovative projects. What if we made it easier for cities to gain access to funding for climate-smart urban infrastructure? Operationally, we believe it’s also important for the Bank to develop new measures of success – such as clear targets that reflect its efforts to address both traditional goals as well as global challenges.Finally, the Bank must boost its financial capacity by responsibly stretching its existing financial resources. Last year’s G20 report on the development banks’ capital adequacy frameworks provides a solid blueprint for this exercise. The United States is strongly supportive of exploring and implementing a range of the report’s recommendations – and doing so quickly. Promising ideas for exploration include increased securitization of private sector portfolios or piloting the issuance of subordinated debt instruments to boost headroom.Just as important as additional financial capacity for the Bank is stronger mobilization of private capital and domestic resources. International public finance alone will come nowhere close to the level of financing needed to effectively tackle global challenges and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. We expect the evolution agenda to reflect the importance of private financing and domestic resource mobilization.We have made real progress over the past four months – as we’ve worked with the Bank and other partners. We have built a robust and growing coalition of borrower and non-borrowing countries that are pressing for the Bank to evolve. That includes my counterparts in Africa, who I saw last month. They share our desire to build a system that is more responsive to the challenges they face. We are coordinating closely with India as it makes MDB evolution a key priority of its G20 presidency. And the World Bank has produced an initial evolution roadmap – which it is now using as a guide for deeper discussions on specific reforms.In the next few months, we expect to see ideas begin to be translated into action. We are pursuing a staged implementation of this evolution. Not all decisions are equally difficult – so let’s make the more straightforward ones first. The first phase of implementation should begin by the World Bank and IMF Spring Meetings in April. Shareholders are already working to coalesce around updates to the Bank’s vision and mission. Management and the Board are in robust discussions about measures to boost financial headroom.But we cannot stop there. Much remains to be done to evolve incentives, reform operational approaches, and increase financial capacity. We expect the World Bank to promptly implement a second phase of work. We are asking for additional reforms to be decided and implementation to begin by the World Bank and IMF Annual Meetings in October. That’s the one-year mark from when this project began.We know we can succeed. The world has gone through tremendous change in the nearly 80 years since the founding of the World Bank. The multilateral development bank system has responded to these changes by evolving. The system has broadened the scope of its work to include programming on human capital and good governance; expanded its set of instruments beyond project loans; increased its focus on policy and technical assistance; and delivered financial innovations.The MDBs are a powerful pillar of a broader financial architecture that should be deployed to address 21st century development challenges. But this requires a 21st century strategy. The need is great. The world is asking us to do all we can to combat these complex and growing problems."

178,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

180,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
181,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

182,,"February 8, 2023","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for that kind introduction. I’m grateful to the leaders and workers of Ultium Cells for having me here today. Construction sites like this give me hope – because they mean that we are in the process of building something new. In this case, it’s a 2.8-million-square foot factory with some of the most advanced battery manufacturing processes in the world. And it’s a factory that will support 1,700 high-tech jobs.The good news is that new factories are not just being built in Spring Hill. All over the country, we are seeing a wave of investments in American manufacturing. This is thanks to the hard work of leaders like Representative Steve Cohen from Tennessee. As the President laid out last night, the Biden economic plan is working – and the results are beginning to reveal themselves.Today, I’d like to speak to you about the President’s economic plan: the progress we’ve achieved and the work that lies ahead. I’ll first begin with our plan to rescue the economy from the depths of the pandemic. That was in 2021. Then, I’ll turn to the historic economic legislation we enacted in 2022. And finally, I’ll talk about 2023 and beyond: the years when we harness the promise of our plan.When the President took office, our country was in the depths of the pandemic. About 400,000 Americans had died from COVID. Three thousand more were dying each day. The public health calamity had triggered an economic one. In January 2021, about 800,000 Americans were filing jobless claims each week. That was higher than the worst moments of the Great Recession. The effects of this economic catastrophe were not just captured in staggering numbers. They were felt by millions across the country. Two years ago, President Biden said in his first address to Congress that: “one of the defining images…of this crisis…has been cars lined up…for miles… waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.” The truth is: in 2020 and 2021, we faced the tail risk of an economic crisis that could match the Great Depression. Short of that, we faced the possibility of a protracted economic downturn that would cast a long shadow on the rest of the decade – with millions of homes, businesses, and livelihoods lost, many to never return.So, the President acted decisively. We launched a vaccination campaign to put shots in arms. Through the American Rescue Plan, we provided immediate relief to households, businesses, and state and local governments. Our plan worked. The past two years have seen a historic recovery. In fact, the pace of our recovery has exceeded many of the more optimistic expectations at the beginning of our Administration. And our economy remains resilient – even as it has been tested by a series of back-to-back global shocks. Take the labor market. The data is clear: our country is back to work. We’ve seen historic employment gains in the past two years. As of last week’s jobs report, over 12 million new jobs have been created since the President took office. Moreover, this resurgence has been inclusive and broad-based. The unemployment rate has been near record lows for Black and Hispanic Americans. And it reached an all-time low for people with disabilities in December. More broadly, across many metrics, Americans are largely in better financial shape than before the pandemic began. The rate of Americans without health insurance reached an all-time low in 2022. Foreclosures rates remain below pre-pandemic averages.  Through the American Rescue Plan, we also helped small businesses stay afloat. But not only that. Since the beginning of the Administration, Americans have applied to start 10 million new businesses. That’s more than in any other two-year period on record. Our economic agenda has jump-started a wave of entrepreneurship that will have lasting effects in the years to come.Of course, we still face serious near-term challenges. Our Administration’s top economic priority has been to tackle inflation. While inflation remains elevated, we are seeing encouraging signs that supply-demand mismatches are now easing in many sectors of the economy. Over the past two years, we have worked successfully to ease supply chain pressures. That includes funding pop-up container yards and moving several ports to 24/7 operations. The President has helped stabilize energy prices through a historic release of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve – as well as the release of millions of barrels from our allies and partners. And where we could not expand supply, we delivered cost relief. Our historic laws have helped many Americans save their hard-earned money – from the cost of insulin to the price of high-speed Internet. As you heard last night, the President and I will continue to work hard to support families – many of whom are still feeling the squeeze of high prices. As our economy continues to transition to steady and healthy growth, I believe that the United States is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the future. Last fall, I toured the country to see the early effects of our transformative suite of legislation. In the past 15 months, we have enacted our generation’s most ambitious investment in infrastructure; led a major expansion of American advanced manufacturing; and passed the boldest climate action in our nation’s history. Let me speak to the three main economic effects of these laws: increasing our productive capacity, bolstering our economic resilience, and creating a more inclusive economy.First, the President’s economic plan is boosting America’s productive capacity. For many years, economists forecasted sluggish growth for the American economy over the next few decades. A country’s long-run growth potential depends on, among other things, the size of our labor force and the productivity of our workers. Our potential was being weighed down by slow productivity growth – along with an aging population that was constraining growth in our labor supply.Faced with these structural challenges, our Administration is pursuing an economic strategy called “modern supply-side economics.” With an economy at full employment, we are undertaking a supply-side expansion that invests in our workforce and its productivity. These investments raise the ceiling for what our economy can produce. Serious economists agree that infrastructure investments can boost productivity and growth. And yet, for decades, we neglected our roads, bridges, public transit, and ports. Over 40,000 bridges are in poor condition. Nearly 900 of those are in Tennessee alone. Beyond traditional infrastructure, millions of Americans still have no access to high-speed Internet service. During the pandemic, I heard heartbreaking stories of parents searching for wi-fi signals outside public libraries and coffee shops – just so their children could complete their homework online. Let me be clear: no parent or child should ever have to do this. So, we are making a generational investment in our infrastructure. We’ve announced thousands of projects under our economic plan. Better public transit to help get students to school. Port improvements to strengthen supply chains and efficiently transport goods to American consumers. Broadband projects to connect millions of unserved and underserved households to high-speed Internet – with much more to come. Airport expansions to help reduce delays – like the one announced for Chattanooga Airport just two hours from here.  Three decades ago, the United States made up 37 percent of global semiconductor production. Today, we produce only 12 percent. With the most advanced chips, we lack any meaningful manufacturing capacity at all. We’ve seen the acute impacts of a chip shortage on the economy. In 2021, this shortage meant a loss of about $240 billion in U.S. GDP. In Tennessee, companies like Nissan had to temporarily shutter production – and consumers faced skyrocketing prices for cars and other everyday goods.Our economic plan is investing in economic resilience. The goal is to mitigate shocks like the ones we experienced to our chip supply. Through grants, loans, and tax credits, we are nurturing the growth of a semiconductor ecosystem in the United States. Our investments in areas like manufacturing and R&D will help mitigate economic and security risks. We are already seeing how expansions of U.S. manufacturing have reverberating effects on local communities. For example, Intel is building a $20 billion semiconductor plant in Ohio – while also investing tens of millions to help train the next generation of chipmakers there. For too long, the American economy has been characterized by widely divergent economic conditions across places. Studies have shown that there are wide gaps in poverty rates, median household incomes, and even rates of opioid addiction across counties in the United States. Too many places were being left behind. Regions that were once hubs of economic activity have suffered from massive disinvestment. We faced a challenge. The transition to a clean energy economy is one of the most transformative in modern history. How do we make sure that this transition is inclusive – so that all of America can reap its benefits? Enter our economic plan. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is laying the groundwork for clean infrastructure in cities and towns across America. The Inflation Reduction Act is offering meaningful tax credits to spur clean energy investment and production. Importantly, the law deliberately encourages place-based investments. It offers additional incentives for businesses to invest in low-income and historic energy communities. And it also requires employers to pay prevailing wages and employ apprentices to receive full credits. That’s a requirement that went into effect last month. The early results are clear: the President’s economic plan is beginning to drive a renewal across the country. For example, we’ve seen a burst of clean energy manufacturing investment in the Midwest and the South. Think about where we are today: a new, state-of-the-art factory that will soon deliver batteries for electric vehicles assembled by GM next door. Just north of us, in Kentucky, Ford and SK On just broke ground on an electric vehicle battery park. South of us, in Georgia, solar panel firm QCells will build a massive new plant outside of Atlanta – which is expected to generate 2,500 jobs. East of that, just outside Charleston, Redwood Materials has announced plans to build a multi-billion-dollar facility to recycle and refine battery components. Its investment is the largest economic development announcement in the history of South Carolina. And its facility is estimated to eventually employ 1,500 workers. The Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law a mere six months ago. Since then, clean energy firms up and down the supply chain have announced tens of billions of dollars in projects that will create thousands of high-quality, good-paying jobs. One analysis indicates that 2022 was a record year for EV battery manufacturing in particular. Last year alone, more than $73 billion in planned projects were announced.Now that these bills have been signed into law, it’s our task to turn their promise into reality. Treasury and other agencies are already hard at work implementing the Biden economic plan. For example, last fall, we announced a series of initiatives to accelerate infrastructure deployment. We are strengthening and accelerating federal permitting reviews. We also launched a Talent Pipeline Challenge to make sure that we are training a highly skilled, diverse infrastructure workforce – one that will be ready to take advantage of the new opportunities in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. At Treasury, our focus is on effective implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act; nearly three-quarters of the law’s climate investments are delivered through tax incentives. To do so, we are bringing a broad and diverse set of stakeholders to the table. And we are working expeditiously to maximize the economic benefits of the legislation – while making sure we enact effective guardrails so benefits are delivered as intended. Over the next year, I suspect that you will see activity accelerate. More ideas turning into plans. Plans into construction sites – just like this one. And construction sites into bustling factories. And with it, I hope, a renewed sense of optimism about America’s future. Let me close with this: I just returned from my first trip to Africa as Treasury Secretary. I met with a variety of people during this trip: from presidents to farmers to entrepreneurs. In all of my interactions, each of them carried a fundamental sense of confidence about the future of the United States. Those across the world know that the world is better when the United States is strong at home. The President and I could not agree more. There will be challenges to come. And there will be difficulties. But as the President said last night, “The story of America is a story of progress and resilience – of always moving forward.”For all that Americans have faced in the last three years, I am convinced now, more than ever, that progress is possible. Together, we can provide a better life for millions of Americans. We can build a country that is more inclusive and resilient. And we can sustain our leadership in the 21st century.  "
183,,"February 3, 2023","WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement following the announcement by the price cap coalition to set price caps on the price of seaborne Russian refined oil products.“I applaud the G7 price cap coalition for jointly setting caps on the price of seaborne Russian refined oil products. Today’s agreement builds on the price cap on Russian crude oil exports that we set in December and helps advance our goals of limiting Russia’s key revenue generator in funding its illegal war while promoting stable global energy markets.We have already seen early progress toward those objectives through the price cap on crude oil exports. Senior Russian officials have repeatedly admitted that the crude oil price cap is cutting into their most important source of revenue and has darkened the Kremlin’s already troubled fiscal outlook. Global energy markets have also remained well-supplied, and public reports indicate that crude oil importers are using the price cap to drive steep bargains on Russian oil imports. Low- and medium-income countries have particularly benefitted from the crude oil price cap, which is helping to shield them from the high global energy costs caused by Putin’s unprovoked war of aggression. Our G7 price cap coalition has committed to undertake a review of the price cap on crude oil in March to ensure that it continues to meet its twin goals, to further diminish Russian revenues while supporting energy market stability.The caps we have just set will now serve a critical role in our global coalition’s work to degrade Russia’s ability to prosecute its illegal war. Combined with our historic sanctions, we are forcing Putin to choose between funding his brutal war or propping up his struggling economy. And, we are disrupting Russia’s military supply chains, making it harder for the Kremlin to equip its troops and continue this unprovoked invasion.”"
184,,"January 27, 2023","I want to start by thanking you and your organizations for being here today and for demonstrating your commitment to South Africa’s just energy transition toward renewable sources.An energy transition that is not just will simply not work. Equally important, however, is the imperative to seize the new opportunities that the transition will offer, keeping a worker-centered perspective in mind at all stages.Indeed, I think we all see both the tremendous need and opportunity for reform of the energy sector in a way that lifts up impacted communities and strengthens sustainable economic growth. That is, in large part, why we joined international partners in creating the Just Energy Transition Partnership or JETP with South Africa.The United States is firmly committed to this engagement. We have pledged to mobilize over $1 billion from across our government over the next three to five years to achieve the just energy transition priorities that the South Africans identified in their JETP Investment Plan.South Africa’s Just Energy Transition Investment Plan is the result of a year’s work. It identifies some $98 billion in necessary investments in clean energy and programming to support the “just” transition over the long term, as well as investment in green hydrogen infrastructure and electric vehicle manufacturing.It is the “just” element of the transition that I want to focus on today, and where we want to collaborate with you closely. The success of the JETP will not be possible unless we support the coalminers and coal mining communities as they transition to new economic activities.$3.5 billion, for the Mpumalanga [em-POO-mah-lahng-uh] Region, which is where I was this morning touring a US-funded renewable energy job training facility for women.These investments cover a range of activities, including funding to support local communities and develop supply chains for new energy technologies; remediating and repurposing coal mining land; improving non-energy infrastructure; and partnering with the coal workforce through job reskilling, mobility payments, and temporary income support for displaced workers.Indeed, we must demonstrate quickly that these coal communities, which are already struggling with unemployment, poverty and the health impacts of coal mining and emissions, will not be left behind in the context of an energy shift that benefits other regions. South Africa will need to see concrete action soon to keep up momentum on the JETP.In recognition of this importance, President Biden went beyond our initial JETP commitment to pledge an additional $45 million focused specifically on the “just” element of the transition. As the Investment Plan lays out though, much more will be needed.At COP27, many of the organizations represented here today pledged to invest $500 million in low- and middle-income countries with ambitious energy transition plans. South Africa fits that bill perfectly and many of you have long histories investing in these very communities we hope to support alongside you.We would like to understand how you are thinking about extending support in the context of the ambitious JETP here in South Africa, where the transition is already at hand and the needs are urgent. I’ll start by asking: how can we work together to achieve the greatest impact for the people of South Africa?"
185,,"January 27, 2023","I was pleased to have the opportunity to visit Mpumalanga Province today to see first-hand the difference that South Africa’s Just Energy Transition Partnership can make in advancing an energy transition in communities like this and ensuring the transition delivers on the “just” promise.The investments that our governments and the private sector are making in renewable energy will play a critical role in creating good-paying jobs and reliable sources of clean energy that will power South Africa’s economic growth.The United States is committed to the South Africa JETP, and we are committed to a transition that is “just” for the communities and workers that are affected.Facilitating a transition that leaves no one behind requires job retraining and reskilling like we saw today. It also requires the redevelopment of former fossil fuel and power sites and investments in infrastructure to support the development of new industries and economic opportunities. That is exactly what the United States is committed to do.The JETP and the initial $8.5 billion financial package from South Africa’s international partners – including the United States – is a demonstration of our support for South Africa as it launches a transition that will grow its economy for the future, expand employment opportunities, capitalize on growing new industries, and improve health outcomes.Seeing the programs here in Mpumalanga today gives me confidence in South Africa's commitment to capitalize on this opportunity, and the U.S. will stand alongside and support South Africa in the years to come."
186,,"January 27, 2023","It is a pleasure to be here today in Emalahleni, “the place of coal,” in some ways the epicenter of South Africa’s Just Energy Transition. Thank you all for the opportunity to meet with you.The work that you are doing here in Emalahleni and in the broader Mpumalanga Province is important for laying the foundation for a successful transition to a cleaner energy system in South Africa.But the investments that our governments and the private sector will make over the coming years in wind, solar, battery storage, and non-energy infrastructure will pay dividends in terms of well- paying jobs and a growing and cleaner economy.Workers are the core of a just transition, and I am so pleased to be able to meet with some of the individuals who are committed to working for South Africa’s sustainable future.In the United States, we are also going through a transition. We were able to pass a massive set of laws designed to invest in the infrastructure of the future and allow us to meet our climate goals.Last September, Presidents Ramaphosa and Biden met in Washington and reaffirmed their commitment to the South Africa Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP.This program is a first-of-its-kind partnership that mobilizes the resources of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the European Union to help South Africa achieve the energy transition goals it has identified.The financial package of $8.5 billion is a substantial down payment. Importantly, it is designed to mobilize additional money from the private sector and philanthropies, and I will meet with representatives from both groups later today.The JETP Investment Plan drafted by South Africa highlights the need for specific programming in Mpumalanga Province, the largest coal-producing region in South Africa.The Plan calls for job retraining and reskilling, cash payments to support displaced workers while they find new employment, redevelopment of former coal mines and coal power plants as clean energy production sites and other productive uses.And it also calls for investment in non-energy infrastructure, including roads, rail, ports, and digital infrastructure that will support new industries.The United States’ commitment to the energy transition being “just” is firm. That is why President Biden made an additional commitment to President Ramaphosa of $45 million in grant funding to support South Africa’s efforts.Through our various agencies, including the U.S. Trade and Development Agency, USAID, Power Africa, the International Development Finance Corporation, and the Departments of State, Energy, and Treasury, we are identifying the highest-value opportunities for investing our resources to help achieve these goals.Our success also depends on committed South Africans such as yourselves. Your hard work to get to where you are, ready and capable of participating fully in the clean energy economy will benefit not only yourselves and your families, but also the whole community of Mpumalanga and South Africa.I want to applaud you for your achievements thus far in being at the forefront of the economy of the future, and also applaud the leadership of Premier Mtweni-Tsipane. I look forward to all that you will accomplish and to learning more during our conversation."
187,,"January 26, 2023","Thank you for that introduction. And thank you for having me here today at Ford. It’s great to be at an American business in South Africa. This factory is a strong example of how deepening economic integration between the U.S. and South Africa — and the continent more broadly — can produce good jobs and boost economic growth for both of us.I began this trip in Senegal. There, I explained that the United States’ strategy toward Africa is centered around a simple recognition: that Africa will shape the future of the global economy. And I explained that the United States is ready to work with Africa as an equal partner — defined not by what we can do for each other, but rather what we can do with each other.We know that a thriving Africa is in the interest of the United States. A thriving Africa means a larger market for our goods and services. It means more investment opportunities for our businesses, like this Ford plant, which can create jobs in Africa and customers for American businesses. And it means that more Americans can benefit from the dynamism and creativity of people in Africa.A key pillar of the U.S. strategy toward Africa is boosting mutually beneficial trade and investment. The United States is South Africa’s third-largest trading partner and a major destination for South African investment. In turn, South Africa is our largest trading partner in Africa. In the coming years, we intend to build on that strong foundation to promote even deeper economic integration here, as well as with other African countries.Indeed, the United States sees tremendous economic potential in Africa. Across the continent, people are becoming more connected to the world than at any other time in history. Importantly, Africa is undergoing a significant demographic boom. By 2050, Africans are projected to make up a quarter of the world’s population. Africa’s working-age population is rapidly growing at a time when other regions face the challenges of aging populations. This presents an extraordinary economic opportunity.Our work to boost trade and investment begins with facilitating business between Americans and Africans. For over two decades, under the African Growth and Opportunity Act, the United States has provided eligible Sub-Saharan countries with duty-free access to our market for thousands of products. South Africa was the biggest beneficiary of this arrangement last year. And since 2021, the United States has helped close more than 800 trade and investment deals in Africa — totaling $18 billion.Some of America’s biggest companies are doubling down on their commitments in Africa. As you know, Ford recently began production of vehicles made possible by its $1 billion investment here in South Africa. Technology companies like Cisco, manufacturing companies like General Electric, and financial firms like Visa have also made new announcements. We believe that leadership in the industries of the future requires close partnership with companies and people in Africa.Prosperity in Africa also requires promoting more trade within Africa. As Africa’s middle class grows, the continent will become a bigger market for its own goods and services. Trade between African countries has the potential to boost good jobs and economic opportunity. And it enables more Africans to benefit from the innovations of their neighbors. That’s why the United States strongly supports the African Continental Free Trade Area. Estimates indicate that this Free Trade Area could boost real income by roughly 9 percent by 2035.As we deepen our economic ties, we believe that sustained trade and investment depends on continued economic development. Trade requires quality roads and bridges; businesses cannot operate in the 21st century without reliable broadband and electricity; and a skilled workforce requires quality education and training.Africa’s infrastructure gap is estimated at over $100 billion annually. To invest in global infrastructure, the G7 has announced a Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. This initiative aims to mobilize $600 billion into a variety of quality infrastructure projects by 2027 — including in Africa. Through the Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Development Finance Corporation, the United States has over ten billion dollars of active commitments and programs in Africa, in areas from telecommunications to renewable energy production. And I have personally convened the multilateral development banks to urge them to step up policy and technical assistance – as well as financing – in infrastructure.Last month, President Biden announced an initiative on digital transformation. We intend to invest over $350 million and facilitate over $450 million in financing for this continent. Funds will go toward expanding Internet access as well as enabling a vibrant digital ecosystem through digital skills and literacy. Strengthening Africa’s digital economy has the potential to unlock innovation, particularly by leveraging the talents of young workers that are early adopters of technology.Let me be clear: we do not take our investments lightly. Our projects and partnerships are motivated by our mutually beneficial, long-term partnership. That’s why we have rigorous accountability, transparency, and technical standards. And that’s why we assist countries with policy reform and capacity building.  We believe these steps help attract private sector investment and deliver better economic returns. We know that people in Africa are interested in economic arrangements that are fair and open – ones that produce projects that are high quality and sustainable over the long term. And we also share a recognition of the importance of strong, open, and accountable institutions that deliver well for people and businesses. I’ve spoken about why U.S. integration with Africa is important for our economic interests. Let me speak briefly about how it furthers our security interests as well.Over the past three years, we have seen how disruptions in one part of the world can shake the global economy. COVID-19 brought the world’s economic activity to a standstill. Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine has raised energy prices and exacerbated food insecurity. These shocks have taught us about the importance of secure and resilient supply chains.As we continue to vigorously promote global economic integration, the United States is pursuing “friendshoring” policies aimed at mitigating vulnerabilities in supply chains. We are addressing the over-concentration of the production of critical goods in certain markets — particularly those that may not share our economic values. To do so, we are deepening economic integration with the many countries that we can count on. That includes our many trusted trading partners on this continent — like South Africa. We believe that this policy can help increase the resilience of both our economies.Success in Africa means success for all of us. A thriving Africa helps support a thriving America. The United States is committed to working with you to deepen our ties: not for show, not for the short-term — but for the long haul."
188,,"January 26, 2023","As Prepared for Delivery

Minister Godongwana I very much look forward to reconnecting with you today. We have spoken several times over the last year, including last October in Washington. I’m glad to be able to continue our conversation here in South Africa.

The United States strongly values our relationship with South Africa.

The Minister and I will discuss how multilateral development banks can better address emerging global challenges, and how that can benefit African countries. And we will discuss South Africa’s role in developing the Pandemic Fund and its continued involvement.

I am also eager to hear the Minister’s views on the Common Framework for debt treatment, given South Africa’s membership in the G20 and its role as co-chair of Zambia’s creditor committee.

And, of course, we will discuss South Africa’s economic outlook and energy sector reforms.

As you know, South Africa is the first country with a Just Energy Transition Partnership – to which the United States was proud to commit as a partner.

This partnership represents South Africa’s bold first step toward expanding electricity access and reliability and creating a low carbon and climate resilient economy, a move that I believe will alleviate the deep fiscal strain the energy sector is putting on South Africa’s economy and support strong economic growth.

The partnership will also invest in the jobs of growing industries so that the transition is just and does not leave anyone behind.

I have appreciated the Minister’s cooperation and insightful views in our talks so far, and I look forward to our discussion today."
189,,"January 25, 2023","Seeing so many different animal species in their natural setting reminds us why it is so important to work together to protect wildlife. I’m concerned to know that this Reserve, like so many other reserves and parks, has experienced poaching.
 To help save wildlife populations from further poaching and disrupt the associated illicit trade, we must “follow the money” in the same way we do with other serious crimes.
 This includes identifying and seizing the proceeds generated from the illegal wildlife trade and impeding the money laundering and cross-border transactions of the transnational criminal organizations often involved in—and who benefit from—corruption.
 Wildlife traffickers, corrupt officials, and other criminals rely on many of the same vulnerabilities in anti-money laundering regulatory regimes, so our efforts to combat wildlife trafficking reinforce our efforts to fight corruption, and vice versa.
 I am here today to demonstrate our shared commitment to these two significant goals for both of our countries: fighting corruption and combating wildlife trafficking.
 To date, Treasury has worked to share information associated with wildlife trafficking, including by providing financial intelligence for law enforcement partners in the U.S. that investigate wildlife trafficking globally.
 Alongside South Africa, Treasury also worked with the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard setting body on combating money laundering and other illicit finance, to identify indicators associated with money laundering and wildlife trafficking.
 There is much more that can be done on this front. Today, I am pleased to speak about a new commitment between the United States and South Africa to combat illicit finance linked to the illegal wildlife trade.
 The U.S. Treasury and South Africa’s National Treasury are committing to form a United States – South Africa Task Force on Combating the Financing of Wildlife Trafficking, which will work to address this critical issue in three key areas.
 First, we will increase information sharing between our financial intelligence units to better support key law enforcement agencies from South Africa and the United States.
 Second, the Task Force will prioritize the sharing of financial red flags and indicators related to wildlife trafficking cases, especially those involving the U.S. financial system and those overlapping with investigations into high-level corruption, drug trafficking, and transnational criminal organizations.
 Finally, U.S. Treasury and our counterparts at the National Treasury will work to strengthen controls in our countries and beyond to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through public-private partnership activities in the region.
 We will convene relevant government authorities, regulators, law enforcement, and the private sector to improve controls to combat money laundering and the illicit proceeds related to drug trafficking and wildlife trafficking.
 Through closer collaboration to target illicit proceeds linked to wildlife trafficking, as well as overlapping criminal activity like corruption, fraud, and drug trafficking, we are taking a step in the right direction today.
 To make an impact against this harmful crime and the illicit financing that accompanies it, we must use this as an opportunity to build a consistent and durable approach.
 "
190,,"January 24, 2023","Thank you very much. It’s great to be here. This project shows how our countries can partner to address two of the most critical issues facing Zambia and the world: food security and climate adaptation.Today, hunger and food insecurity are exacting a heavy toll on communities around the world, including right here in Zambia. The number of people facing acute food insecurity has risen to 345 million across over 80 countries. In Zambia, around 2 million people face acute food insecurity — and nearly half of the population is unable to meet their minimum caloric intake requirements.Global food systems have been strained for some time by climate change, regional conflicts, and COVID’s economic disruptions. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in Africa. And this difficult situation has been exacerbated by Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine, which has further stressed food, fuel, and fertilizer prices across the world. Russia’s war has cut off significant supplies of wheat, corn, and sunflower oil destined to global markets, including in Africa, leading to shortages and price spikes. Higher global energy prices raised shipping costs for food and other commodities, squeezing cash-strapped countries. And a surge in the price of fertilizer has hurt agricultural output in communities across Africa.The first to be hit hard are the world’s poor – in the United States as well, but particularly in developing countries in Africa and elsewhere. Simply put, Russia’s unprovoked war of aggression against its neighbor has hurt Africa by exacerbating existing food insecurity and creating an unnecessary drag on the continent’s economy.During last month’s Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, President Biden and I met with African heads of state to discuss how we can redouble our efforts to strengthen food security. Today, I want to speak to the actions we are taking to respond to the urgent food security crisis. I would also like to speak to our long-term partnership with African nations to build more resilient food systems. Our goal is to get to a place where the need for humanitarian aid is exceptional and rare. And we want to advance a future where Africa participates more fully in global food and fertilizer markets and supply chains.The United States is taking strong and immediate actions to alleviate hunger. Last year, the United States committed $13 billion in humanitarian and food security assistance across the globe. This includes President Biden’s announcement last month of $2 billion in emergency, lifesaving assistance in Africa.We have also rallied countries and international organizations to avoid export restrictions and impediments to humanitarian aid delivery. It is important that food and other critical supplies can flow more freely. The United States has made sure to exempt food and key agricultural commodity exports from its sanctions programs to further enable their flow onto global markets.And with our partners, we are leading efforts to stabilize global energy prices by introducing a cap on the price of Russian oil. This policy maintains flows of discounted Russian oil – helping mitigate further price shocks on emerging economies while also reducing Russian revenues.While the policy is in the early stages of implementation, Treasury estimates that it could result in around $6 billion in annual savings for the 17 largest net oil-importing African countries.We are also working with international financial institutions to surge and scale their food security efforts. Last April, I convened a “call to action” with the heads of these institutions and representatives from the G7 and G20 to spur coordinated global action. The World Bank is implementing up to $30 billion in projects — including $12 billion in new programming — to respond to the food security crisis. The African Development Bank continues to advance a $1.5 billion facility to address the food crisis in Africa. This facility is projected to benefit 20 million African smallholder farmers. With new seeds and fertilizer, these farmers will be better prepared to rapidly produce up to 38 million tons of wheat, maize, rice, and soybeans to meet the demands of the continent.As we tackle acute needs now, we must also take a longer view and scale up investment in long term food system resilience. Africa is a perfect example of these dual challenges. It is a continent that faces acute food needs. But it is one that also has the potential not only to feed itself but also to help feed the world – if the right steps are taken. As an example, Zambia’s maize production has the potential to turn it into a regional food hub.Under President Biden’s leadership, the United States announced a U.S.-Africa strategic partnership on food security at the Africa Leaders Summit last month. We will work together to improve Africa’s access to global agricultural commodity markets and meet its growing demand for fertilizer. And we will promote effective agricultural practices and approaches, including strengthening climate resilience.Let me speak for a moment specifically on climate. We know that over the last decade, storms, floods, and droughts in Africa have increased in severity and frequency. This has hurt agricultural yields. The same is true globally as well. Indeed, farmers – like the ones we work with here – are often the first witnesses of the changing climate and its consequences. They know that climate change is not just a future threat; it is already here.We must take urgent action to adapt agricultural practices and technology to the changing climate. The project we are visiting today helps small-scale farmers better manage the impacts of climate change. It’s funded by the Green Climate Fund, which the United States is proud to be a part of. We are committed to making sure that the Fund has sufficient resources to carry on this important work. We are also advancing climate adaptation through our latest $155 million contribution to the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program. We are prioritizing innovative projects, such as providing farmers with new seeds that are more resilient to droughts, heat, and other extreme conditions. Already today, two-thirds of the Program’s projects are climate-related.Africa’s long-term strategy to address food security also requires developing its infrastructure and logistics capabilities. The continent needs a robust capacity not only to grow food, but to make sure it can be cultivated, stored, and efficiently transported. The G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment will mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars over the next five years into a range of global infrastructure investments. The United States is also advocating against export bans in the agricultural sector so that food can move more freely. And we are strongly supportive of increased trade between African countries through the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area.An issue of personal importance to me is the role of women in the economy and society. In Zambia, women constitute more than half of the agricultural labor force. And yet significant gender inequities persist in access to land, capital, seeds, and fertilizer. This suppresses agricultural productivity and harms output. I believe that we must advance the cause of women farmers across Africa. It’s the right thing to do. But it is also crucial for food security and the economy.This is a difficult time for many in Africa and around the globe. But that makes our partnership even more important. As President Biden said last month, it’s not just about showing the will to work with Africans. It’s also about doing the hard work of tackling these challenges together. We are prepared to do just that."
191,,"January 23, 2023","The United States highly values our relationship with Zambia, and we seek to deepen our economic cooperation over the coming years. Our partnership is particularly crucial as we face significant global economic headwinds – including spillovers from Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine.We had a wide-ranging discussion in December about Zambia’s economic recovery and growth, addressing debt sustainability, and deepening our trade and investment ties.I look forward to further conversation about the broad economic reforms that your government is undertaking to deliver sustainable growth and reduce poverty.The United States insists that all major bilateral official and private creditors meaningfully participate in this debt relief, including China. It is our view that timely and comprehensive debt treatment can serve the interests of both debtors and creditors.In addition, President Hichilema and I will discuss how Zambia can help to tackle global challenges that have serious ramifications at the national level, including food security, which has worsened in this country and globally over the past year, as well as investing in healthy populations and preparedness for future health shocks.I greatly appreciate the opportunity to exchange views with President Hichilema here in Zambia, and for his warm welcome and hospitality. I look forward to our conversation and continued work to strengthen our bilateral economic integration."

193,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
194,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

196,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."

and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1. For additional analysis on Treasury market liquidity conditions, see (for example): “Resilience redux in the Treasury Market” by Darrell Duffie (August 25, 2023) and “How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Evolved in 2023” by Michael Fleming (October 17, 2023).2. Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

198,,"January 23, 2023","It’s a pleasure to see you again following the Finance Ministers Dinner that I hosted at the U.S. Treasury in October. It is a privilege to be here and to see your beautiful country firsthand.The United States highly values our relationship with Zambia. For decades, our countries have had a warm relationship based on mutual cooperation and trust. We look forward to growing our economic cooperation in the coming years, including through an engagement to strengthen the capacity of your Public-Private Partnership Unit through our Office of Technical Assistance.I am also eager to continue our long-standing conversations on a range of subjects, including Zambia’s impressive progress on a broad set of economic reforms, and how regional economic integration and deepening trade and investment ties can support Zambia’s economic growth.I consider the timely finalization of debt treatment for Zambia to be a top priority for the Treasury Department. We will continue to press for all official bilateral and private sector creditors to meaningfully participate in debt relief for Zambia, especially China.I hope that we can also continue our discussion on how multilateral development banks can evolve to better tackle both traditional development needs and increasingly complex global challenges, such as climate change, pandemics, and spillovers from fragility and conflict."
199,,"January 23, 2023","I want to thank the Zambia National Public Health Institute for the opportunity to see your investments in public health and pandemic preparedness firsthand.I would also like to express my appreciation for ZNPHI’s partnership with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to train front-line epidemiologists, who are often the first to detect and respond to disease outbreaks. And, I welcome the deepening of this partnership and the new cooperative agreement between our countries that will help ZNPHI grow its national and regional health security role, including through the launch of a new Emergency Operations Center.  Centers like this serve as hubs for better coordinating the preparation, response, and recovery for public health emergencies, and play an important role in early warning systems to help detect and stop outbreaks.Health security has been a key pillar of the partnership between Zambia and the United States over the past two decades, primarily through PEPFAR and the Government of Zambia’s investments in the fight against HIV/AIDS.  Today, we continue to broaden that partnership.It is important to sustainably finance our public health institutions since the cost of preparedness pales in comparison to the human and economic cost of future health threats.  We all saw this first-hand with COVID-19. The United States remains committed to the work of improving regional and global health security, as is evidenced by our $450 million contribution to the newly launched Pandemic Fund.  This Fund will catalyze investments to fill critical gaps in pandemic preparedness and bolster overall health security.  I encourage Zambia and all eligible countries to look for the Fund’s first call for proposals in the coming weeks and to work with their health partners to apply for financing to continue strengthening pandemic preparedness at the national, regional, and global levels. Today we will also see a facility from a U.S. firm that has invested here in Zambia to help distribute anti-malarials and HIV anti-retrovirals, while creating local jobs. "
200,,"January 21, 2023","Thank you very much for joining me here today.  Breaking ground on this project is an important marker of the progress we are making on electrification across Africa and the world.Senegal has among the highest rates of electrification across Sub-Saharan Africa, estimated at between 70 and 80%.  Yet significant disparities between urban and rural access to electricity remain.Expanding electricity to disconnected areas helps people start new businesses, gives children access to new educational resources, and facilitates residents’ access to basic services.Simply put, this groundbreaking will create a higher quality of life in many communities, and it will help Senegal’s economy grow and prosper.  It will also help Senegal get one step closer to its goal of universal electricity access by 2025.A key focus of my trip to Senegal and two other countries in Africa is to discuss ways in which the U.S. and the continent can partner together to benefit both of our economies.This project includes extending power to households and businesses that ultimately will see more than 350,000 people secure reliable electricity. And it includes an important renewable energy element with a solar grid to power 70 villages.This project demonstrates that we can broaden economic opportunity in Senegal, as well as in America. The work being done is supported by an Illinois-based engineering and construction firm – Weldy Lamont Associates – and will help support approximately 500 American jobs in 14 U.S. states. Congratulations to all the staff here in Senegal and back in the U.S. who have made this milestone today of breaking ground possible.The United States was pleased to support this important investment in Senegal through technical assistance from the U.S-led Power Africa initiative, capacity building through the U.S. Agency for Trade and Development, and a $91 million loan guarantee from the Export-Import Bank.Our goal is to further deepen our economic relationship and to invest in expanding energy access in a way that uses renewable resources spread across the continent. With this approach, Senegal can rely on energy sources that are within its borders, cost effective and not prone to volatility in prices. And we are well underway. Since 2021, the U.S. Government has helped facilitate more than 800 two-way trade and investment deals across 47 African countries – for a total estimated value of over $18 billion.Along with our G7 partners, we launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, or PGII, a values-driven, high-impact, and transparent partnership to help meet the infrastructure needs of low- and middle-income countries.Partners across the U.S. government working on supporting infrastructure development through the PGII are deeply engaged in the region and announcing new projects and initiatives on a rolling basis.The United States is here as a partner and friend for the long haul.  This project is just one small – yet impactful – example of a broad and deep partnership."
201,,"January 21, 2023","Here at Goree Island, I can’t help but think about the unspeakable cruelty of those who engaged in the slave trade. I feel an overwhelming sense of sadness and pain thinking about those stolen from their families, their deadly journey across the Atlantic, and the horrific circumstances encountered by those who made it alive.Ultimately, Gorée Island reminds us that the histories of Africa and America are intimately connected. Gorée and the trans-Atlantic slave trade are not just a part of African history. They are a part of American history as well. We know that the tragedy did not stop with the generation of humans taken from here. Even after slavery was abolished, Black Americans – many of whom can trace their descendance through ports like this across Africa – were denied the rights and freedoms promised to them under our Constitution. In both Africa and the United States, even as we have made tremendous strides, we are still living with the brutal consequences of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.I think it is important not only to speak about the transgressions of those who engaged in the slave trade, but also to tell the story of the enslaved people. And that story, while full of suffering, is also full of perseverance and hope. In the United States, what is remarkable is how many African American men and women overcame the odds, created better lives for themselves and their descendants, and became central to our economy and democracy — building our cities, powering our industries, and bending the conscience of the United States and the world toward justice. All of this in the face of systemic social and economic injustice.With remembrance, I believe, can come progress and renewal. And that is what we see here. Today, there are signs of vibrant life around Gorée — a prominent art scene, a place of education, and thousands who call this place home. And, inspired by America’s quest for racial justice, in 2020 the island’s main plaza dropped its colonial roots and changed its name to Freedom and Human Dignity Square. Gorée is now emblematic of what we all know well about the African continent itself: a hub of culture and activity, a land with a painful colonial past but a hopeful future, and a symbol of the enduring universal value of human dignity.What I take from this place is the importance of redoubling our commitment to fight for our shared values and principles wherever they are threatened – in the United States, in Africa, and around the world. We have more work to do."
202,,"January 20, 2023","It’s a pleasure to see you following the Finance Ministers Dinner I hosted at the U.S. Treasury on the margins of the IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings last October. Mr. Minister, as you know, the United States highly values our bilateral relationship with Senegal.  Senegal is a major economic center in West Africa and an important partner to the United States. We have much to discuss on how best to meet the challenges both of our countries face, including in the context of global financial tightening and an increasingly uncertain global economic environment.At the same time, as advanced and emerging economies have slowed down in response to the most recent global shock of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the external environment for developing economies like Senegal has become more challenging.Minister Bâ and I will build on our conversation from last fall to discuss how to build a more resilient global economy in the face of overlapping shocks.We will also speak about opportunities for us to partner together to protect the global financial system from illicit actors while supporting a robust and resilient Senegalese economy, with strong institutions, able to better address domestic and international challenges.Thank you, Minister Bâ, for the opportunity to discuss how the United States and Senegal can work together to weather a more challenging external environment and protect the global financial system. "
203,,"January 20, 2023","Thank you all for being here today.  I am very grateful to be joined by a group of impressive business leaders in Senegal.  

An overriding focus of my trip to Africa is the enormous economic potential of the continent, thanks to its demographic trends and the impressive dynamism of its entrepreneurs.

I saw that spirit firsthand earlier today at DER/FJ, an incubator that works to support new businesses from both young and women Senegalese entrepreneurs.

The U.S. is committed to working with Africa to realize that promise, because we know that a stronger African economy is good for the world, and good for the United States.  

An enormous strength that the U.S. brings to our partnership with Africa is the vibrancy of U.S. companies.  We believe that increased business-to-business engagement will create great opportunities for both our countries.  

Indeed, a major focus of the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit of last month was the importance of deepening trade and investment links. 

I look forward to hearing how you see the opportunities here in Senegal and across the region.  In addition, I would welcome your thoughts on the improvements needed to facilitate trade and investment, and the types of support that are most helpful to investors.

With that, I would like to hear about your backgrounds and experience, particularly what drew you to work in Senegal.  What led you to where you are today?"
204,,"January 20, 2023","I’m grateful to be here. Senegal is known as a bustling economic center in West Africa and a strong voice for international cooperation on the world stage. But to many visitors, it is also known for the extraordinary warmth and generosity of its people. I’ve personally felt that during this visit. So, thank you for your kind welcome: I now understand first-hand why Senegal is called the Land of Teranga. 
 And I’m delighted to be here at DER. This organization epitomizes the promise of the young people and women of Senegal. The vibrant spirit that I’ve felt here, and in Senegal more broadly, furthers my belief in the future of this country and the region. 
 Last month, I had the opportunity to meet with African heads of state — including President Sall — at the Africa Leaders Summit in Washington. President Biden and I conveyed to these leaders a simple message: the United States is all in on Africa, and all in with Africa. There is much work to do to tackle the many challenges facing Africa and the globe. But we believe that Africa will shape the future of the global economy. Africa’s demographic boom can create massive economic opportunity. And its talents and resources can grow global industries and drive global innovation. 
 In other words, Africa’s success will mean success for all of us. And the United States is here as a partner to help Africa realize its massive economic potential at home and advance its growing leadership abroad. 
 Africa’s incredible promise is why the United States outlined a new Strategy Toward Sub-Saharan Africa. This strategy seeks to modernize our relationship by focusing on what we can do together, rather than what we can do for each other. It’s a relationship based on mutual cooperation and greater ambition. And it’s why we are taking serious, concerted efforts to deepen and sustain engagement with Africa. In this new year, the President, the Vice President, and several of my cabinet counterparts will also travel to a number of African countries. 
 Our engagement is not transactional, for show, or for the short-term. We are here to work with you as friends and partners for the long haul — through moments of stress and times of opportunity.
 Over the course of my trip, I intend to bring that message of promise and partnership directly to the people of Senegal, Zambia, South Africa, and the continent more broadly. That begins today. I’ll start by discussing Africa’s tremendous economic opportunity. Then, I’ll turn to our partnership on global priorities, including climate, health, and conflict. Finally, I will discuss how success on all of these objectives depends on strong, open, and accountable institutions. 
 Africa’s demographics present massive promise. In less than 30 years, Africans are projected to make up a quarter of the world’s population. But it’s not just a matter of sheer numbers. Across the continent, people are becoming more educated, urbanized, and connected to the world than at any other time in history. And while many other regions face aging populations, Africa continues to lead as the youngest continent in the world. Here in Senegal, the median age is 19 years. 1.7 million Africans now enter the job market every month. And by 2035, the number of Sub-Saharan Africans reaching working age will exceed that of the rest of the world combined. 
 A rising share of working-age people presents an opportunity for the continent. More workers can drive growth, generating more resources to increase investment, and making educating the young and supporting the vulnerable easier. Africa’s growing middle class also presents an opportunity for the United States. It means a bigger market for products. And it means more investment opportunities for American firms that are already creating jobs on the continent. This can be a win-win for our economies. 
 But demographics is not destiny. Africa’s demographic momentum can propel economic growth if, and only if, adequate investments are made today to create economic opportunity for all. Some, however, rightly warn of the opposite danger. Throughout history, young populations without opportunity can spell greater risk of unrest and conflict.
 This is Africa’s most daunting and most promising task: to provide broad and inclusive opportunity to the next generation of Africans. I believe it is a challenge with enormous consequences for the world as well. 
 Luckily, Africa holds in its hands the ability to shape this future. And the United States is committed to working with Africa, knowing that a strong Africa will benefit us as well. This partnership begins with two pillars of our engagement: economic development and mutually beneficial trade and investment. Africans must determine for themselves how best to drive their economic growth. But there are helpful lessons that Africa can draw from the rest of the world. For example, we know that no sustained economic growth can occur without basic infrastructure and services. 
 The United States is committed to building on Africa’s significant progress in economic development over the past few decades. This includes investing in Africa’s people through improved access to quality education and healthcare – along with high-quality infrastructure. Today, our Development Finance Corporation alone has more than $11 billion in active commitments across the region. The Millennium Challenge Corporation is working in 14 African countries with over $3 billion in active programs, with more in the pipeline. And the G7 aims to mobilize $600 billion into global infrastructure investments over the next five years as part of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment.
 Digital infrastructure has been a key focus. Connectivity provides massive potential: to create good jobs and capitalize on Africa’s growing entrepreneurial ecosystem. As everyone here knows, African startups now touch almost every sector of the economy. Last month, President Biden announced a new digital initiative with Africa. We intend to invest over $350 million to expand affordable internet access and boost digital skills and entrepreneurship. As Africans build their digital infrastructure, we are also connecting them with trusted suppliers — those with robust privacy and cybersecurity standards. 
 America’s investments in Africa are motivated by our mutually beneficial, long-term partnership. The goal is to generate positive economic returns while fostering sustainable debt.  So, our investments prioritize rigorous technical standards. And they reflect high standards for accountability and transparency, along with careful consideration of risks to debt sustainability. 
 Over the past two years, the United States has helped facilitate more than 800 trade and investment deals across 47 African countries. Programs like Prosper Africa boost our economic integration by helping U.S. and African businesses and investors identify new partners and opportunities for growth. And for over two decades, we have provided Senegal and other eligible Sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to the U.S. market for thousands of products. We pursue deeper economic integration with Africa because we believe that it is in our best economic interests. Our leadership in the industries of the future depends on our partnership with Africa — industries like clean energy, electric vehicles, and cutting-edge technology. But we know that expanding trade beyond the continent is not enough. African products and innovations should be made more readily accessible to Africans themselves. That’s why the United States is strongly supportive of the African Continental Free Trade Area. Once fully implemented, this free trade area will encompass over 1.3 billion people with a combined GDP of over $3 trillion. Estimates indicate that it could raise real income by roughly 9 percent by 2035.
 As we deepen our engagement in Africa, we are cognizant that these long-term investments are taking place amid one of the most volatile periods in recent history. Prior to 2020, several African countries ranked among the fastest-growing economies in the world. We saw substantial alleviation of poverty on the continent. But the COVID pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine have led to slower growth and pushed millions of Africans into poverty and hunger. 
 Let me be clear: the single best thing we can do to help the global economy is to end Russia’s illegal and unprovoked war in Ukraine. Russia’s barbaric aggression against its neighbor is particularly being felt by Africa and its people. Russia’s war and weaponization of food has exacerbated food insecurity and caused untold suffering. And the global economic headwinds caused by the actions of a single man — President Putin — is creating an unnecessary drag on Africa’s economy.The United States is partnering with African leaders to mitigate the damage caused by Russia. Last year, we committed around $13 billion in emergency aid and food assistance. And we worked to unlock Ukrainian food exports in the Black Sea Grain Initiative, including those headed to Africa. We are now establishing a U.S.-Africa strategic partnership on food security. This partnership will address the short-term needs of upwards of 300 million Africans affected by the food crisis. And it will also help build resilient and sustainable food systems for the long term.
 Russia’s brutal war has also threatened energy security around the world. We have worked with a coalition of countries to implement a cap on the price of Russian crude oil. And we will soon do the same for Russian refined products. The aim is to stabilize global energy prices and reduce Russian revenues. While the policy is in the early stages of implementation, Treasury estimates that it has the potential to result in around $6 billion in annual savings for the 17 largest net oil-importing African countries. We are seeing examples of emerging markets saving even more by using the price cap to negotiate steeper discounts with Russia. And we encourage more countries to do the same.
 Finally, we have seen the impacts of global turmoil on debt sustainability. Debt is a critical instrument for development when it is used well — that is, as part of a broader financial strategy that includes effectively mobilizing domestic resources. We support countries putting in place strong debt management and transparency practices. But we know that countries that do so can still fall into debt distress. 
 We believe that it is important to provide timely and comprehensive debt treatments. Many African economies are suffering from a lack of fiscal space, but they must be able to continue to make important public investments. And many simply have unsustainable debt burdens. We believe that the international community, including China, needs to provide meaningful debt relief to help countries regain their footing. Timely debt relief is in the interests of both debtors and creditors. 
 As Africa unlocks its economic promise, the United States will continue to support its growing role on the world stage. African countries firmly belong at the table. Their communities are disproportionately vulnerable to the effects of global challenges. And any serious solution requires African leadership and African voices. This is one reason why we support the addition of the African Union as a permanent member of the G20. Africa’s voice should not be one of an invited guest, but that of a full member.
 Africa is responsible for only 2 to 4 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. But the continent is among the most susceptible to the devastating effects of climate change. African countries include 17 of the world’s top 20 climate-vulnerable countries. 
 At the same time, we believe that Africa is uniquely positioned to play a growing role in our efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change. The Congo Basin — the “lungs of Africa” — serves as the world’s largest carbon sink. The continent is particularly well placed to take advantage of energy from renewable sources like the wind, sun, and geothermal. And we know that African ingenuity will help pioneer the next generation of clean energy technologies. 
 Over the coming years, the United States will expand its partnership with Africa on conservation, climate adaptation, and access to clean energy. Since 2021, our Administration has invested and intends to provide over $1 billion to support African-led climate efforts. Here in Senegal, we have partnered in the construction of the largest wind farm in West Africa: a 158-megawatt power plant near Dakar. This project is helping two million people gain access to power for the first time — in addition to mitigating the release of greenhouse gases. Later in this trip, I will speak to how we are facilitating a just energy transition in South Africa.  
 As we partner with Africa on clean energy, let me be clear: it is unacceptable that a continent with such rich potential for clean energy is also the one with the greatest energy deficit. Six hundred million Africans still lack access to electricity. The United States is committed to partnering with African countries to close this gap. Power Africa has already helped connect more than 165 million Africans to electricity — and we believe its work is more important than ever.As with the changing climate, we also know that Africa has been disproportionately impacted by global health challenges. Africa has long been on the world’s front lines against severe diseases — from malaria to HIV/AIDS to Ebola. 
 History demonstrates what we can do together. Together, we have mitigated recurring outbreaks of Ebola in Africa. Our largest foreign assistance program, PEPFAR — designed to respond to HIV/AIDS — has saved over 25 million lives over the past two decades. Thanks to our sustained partnership, rates of African child and maternal mortality have plummeted, along with the rates of Africans dying from malaria.
 U.S.-Africa health cooperation not only saves the lives of people in Africa. It helps mitigate health security threats to the U.S. and the world. That’s why the United States has committed nearly $20 billion to health programs in Africa since 2021. Over the past year, we have worked intensely with our partners — including Senegal — to establish and operationalize the $1.6 billion Pandemic Fund to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future pandemics, across Africa and beyond. 
 Conflict causes immense human suffering. It also stunts economic growth. Growth in countries engaged in intense conflicts is about 2.5 percent lower than countries not engaged in conflict. Last fall, I hosted ten African finance ministers for a dinner in Washington; all of them cited conflict as a major concern. They discussed the strain that security spending places on overstretched budgets at the expense of other public investments like health and education. 
 Effective solutions to fragility and conflict must include both short-term security responses as well as long-term investments in broadening economic opportunity. Through the Global Fragility Act, the United States is partnering with African countries to outline a comprehensive strategy for tackling conflict and promoting stability. This includes empowering those who have historically been left out.
 Maintaining sustained action on these global challenges will require an evolution of our international institutions. The multilateral development banks already play a strong role in supporting poverty reduction and economic growth across Africa. But these banks should also tackle the growing threat of transnational challenges as part of their core work. We believe that these banks can make significant progress on the challenges that I just spoke about: climate, health, and conflict. And we believe that doing so reinforces work on poverty and growth. After all, global challenges have a disproportionate impact on the poor.
 Our request for this evolution is already underway with the World Bank. Over time, we intend to roll this out to other banks, including the African Development Bank. We look forward to working with African nations to shape the trajectory of these reforms. 
 So, success in the work that I’ve spoken about today requires a reform of international institutions. Success also requires investment in African institutions themselves. Surveys indicate that women and men in Africa are calling for greater accountability and transparency from their governments. Africans know that these reforms are a prerequisite for effective delivery of basic services and sustainable economic growth. 
 America’s own experience demonstrates the power of democratic institutions. Our economic development has been underpinned by institutions that, while imperfect, have enabled us to expand opportunity and grow living standards. We know that the road towards democracy and openness can sometimes be difficult. But our experience shows that it is worth it.
 We pledge to work with African countries to help build institutional capacity. Indeed, our engagement with Africa prioritizes adherence to high standards like transparency, good governance, accountability, and environmental sustainability. In certain cases, we also condition our investments on political reforms. These reforms help enable effective use of funds and mobilization of private sector investments. 
 While our approach may be exacting, we believe it delivers lasting results. Countries need to be wary of shiny deals that may be opaque and ultimately fail to actually benefit the people they were purportedly designed to help in the first place. This can leave countries with a legacy of debt, diverted resources, and environmental destruction.
 The United States has taken a different approach. At Treasury, our technical assistance programs have helped African partners build up their public financial management capacities. And we have used our tools to combat corruption and illicit finance. Two months ago in South Africa, we hosted a banking dialogue with government and financial sector representatives from over a dozen African jurisdictions. Our officials discussed common challenges related to combatting corruption and illicit finance, as well as strengthening financial integration between African countries and the United States. We have sanctioned officials in countries from Liberia to Mali for their involvement in corruption. And as illicit actors exploit weaknesses in the international financial system, we are working to strengthen global standards to improve corporate transparency and combat money laundering. Africa’s transformation over the next few decades will reshape the 21st century global economy. The coming decades will see a demographic shift the likes of which we have rarely seen in recent history. If we make the right investments today, this demographic momentum can translate into economic momentum. And Africa’s transformation will have effects that reach far beyond its borders. 
 Some speak about Africa rising over the next few decades. But I see it differently. While it has not always been adequately highlighted, Africa has always been at the center of world history. It is, after all, the birthplace of humanity. And over the past few centuries, our histories have been intertwined, with our people’s drawing strength and inspiration from each other in our respective struggles for civil rights. Today, the world continues to be enriched by the ingenuity and culture of Africa. In this job, I have been fortunate to have had the counsel of an American immigrant born in Nigeria: Wally Adeyemo, who is our Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. 
 Our collective work over the coming years can build a continent — and a world — that is more prosperous, open, and secure. I look forward to working with you to make that vision a reality.

205,,"January 20, 2023","As Prepared for Delivery
Thank you very much for joining me and thank you for the tour of the facility. 

An overriding focus of my trip to Africa is the enormous economic potential the continent has, thanks to its demographic trends and the impressive dynamism of its growing cohort of young and diverse entrepreneurs.  

The women assembled here today are testament to the actualization of that potential, and also the ability to make a difference today in the lives and livelihoods of Senegalese.

The U.S. is committed to working with Africa to realize the promise of a better economic future, because we know that a stronger African economy is good for the world, and good for America.  The work you are doing here is incredible.  

DER/FJ’s work is just one more example of the power of innovation and collaboration between public and private sector leaders.  Women and young people across Senegal have been able to create better jobs for themselves and others and live a higher quality-of-life because of the spirit of inclusion, innovation, entrepreneurship, and care inside of this building. 

It is also striking that so many of the businesses are focused on providing local solutions, centered on improving the lives of their customers, for example nutritious foods that are locally sourced or digital upskilling to give students a competitive edge. 

In just a few moments, I’ll outline my vision for our nations’ shared partnership, and how we can work together to propel Africa’s economic success in the coming decades.  I will talk about how our success depends on working in partnership with Africa, not on behalf of Africa.

To do that requires learning and listening.  So, I look forward to learning from you: I want to hear about the successes and challenges you've faced as women and young entrepreneurs, and what types of support – whether public or private, local or international – have been most helpful along the way.  What specific challenges are you facing in advancing your business goals over the coming year?  And how can we work with you to meet them?

Thank you. "
206,,"January 20, 2023","It’s a sincere pleasure to see you so soon following the U.S. – Africa Leaders’ Summit in Washington in December.  And it’s a pleasure to meet with you today – as the first women to serve in our positions.
 As you know, the United States highly values our bilateral relationship with Senegal, and we view you as an important partner to the United States.  
 In our conversation today, we will speak about redoubling our efforts to expand economic opportunity to youth and women, which I know is an issue that you care about deeply.  
 Indeed, after our meeting, I will be visiting the General Delegation for Rapid Entrepreneurship of Women and Youth, a flagship Senegalese initiative that demonstrates how the U.S. and Senegal have partnered together to advance economic empowerment. 
 Beyond that, I know that we have a lot to discuss, including how the multilateral development banks must evolve to better address cross-border challenges like climate change, conflict, fragility, and pandemics.  
 The multilateral development banks should adapt their vision, incentives, operational approaches, and financial capacity to respond effectively to cross-border challenges.  
 We will discuss how they can be most responsive to current and emerging needs without sacrificing their core goals of poverty alleviation and economic growth for developing countries. I greatly appreciate being able to travel to Senegal – and making this my first stop on the continent.  
 Thank you, Minister Sarr, for the opportunity to discuss how the United States and Senegal can build a strong and more resilient global economy together.  "
207,,"January 18, 2023","Last November, President Biden and President Xi met at the G-20 in Bali for their first in-person presidential meeting. The leaders emphasized the importance of keeping the lines of communication open between our countries.  Amid a complicated global economic outlook, there is a pressing need for the two largest economies in the world to closely communicate on global macroeconomic and financial conditions and exchange views on how we are responding to various challenges.To that extent, I hope we can use today’s in-person meeting to delve deeply into topics of mutual concern, including macroeconomic cooperation and climate finance.We will also have the opportunity in this meeting to frankly address areas of concern.  But, as President Biden said, we share a responsibility to show that China and the United States can manage our differences and prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict.While we have areas of disagreement, and we will convey them directly, we should not allow misunderstandings, particularly those stemming from a lack of communication, to unnecessarily worsen our bilateral economic and financial relationship."

He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
209,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here.

210,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
211,,"November 21, 2023",
212,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
213,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1. For additional analysis on Treasury market liquidity conditions, see (for example): “Resilience redux in the Treasury Market” by Darrell Duffie (August 25, 2023) and “How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Evolved in 2023” by Michael Fleming (October 17, 2023).2. Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

214,,"December 16, 2022","WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement following the directive of the European Union to move forward with implementing a global minimum tax on corporations.“I welcome the decision by all 27 member states of the European Union to adopt a Directive implementing a global minimum tax on corporations. This momentous act means that the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework political agreement on international tax will be implemented by one of the world’s leading economic groupings. The rules we agreed on last year at the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework will reform the international tax system and make it fit for purpose for the 21st century.  The United States led the world in being the first to adopt a minimum tax on the foreign earnings of domestically parented multinational enterprises, and both I and the President remain deeply committed to take the additional steps needed to implement this agreement, too.  This historic agreement helps level the playing field for U.S. business while protecting U.S. workers.Crucially, implementing this international tax deal will change the world’s corporate tax system to benefit American workers and middle-class families. In the United States, rather than being rewarded for moving operations overseas, companies will be incentivized to keep jobs and headquarters at home. And rather than tax havens keeping the profits of U.S. companies, those profits can instead flow back to the United States, allowing us to further invest in our infrastructure, our economy, and our people.”"
215,,"December 15, 2022","President Sall, Minister of Finance Bâ, and other honored guests, I am pleased to welcome you and this important delegation from Senegal to Washington today.The United States highly values our bilateral relationship with Senegal. Senegal is a major economic center in West Africa and an important partner to the United States. As Chair of the African Union, Senegal also plays a key role as a leader on the continent. We have much to discuss on how best to meet the challenges we face, including food security and the need for sustainable infrastructure investment to boost economic growth and prosperity.Senegal, like many other countries, has experienced rising food security challenges, including in terms of access and pricing. Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine has added further stress to the system, and raised local food and fertilizer costs beyond reach for vulnerable populations.President Sall and I will discuss how the international community can further work with Senegal – and African countries more broadly – to address short-term food security needs and the long-term imperative to promote transformational investments in sustainable and resilient food systems. The International Financial Institutions’ Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity is an important tool in this regard.We will also speak about the need for sustainable, high-quality, infrastructure investment. By working together, we can make the African economy stronger and more resilient. These investments are vital for unlocking the enormous economic potential of Africa in the decades to come. And a prosperous continent won’t just benefit Africa – it will make the American and global economy stronger as well.We have already made progress in this area. As just one example, the U.S. Development Finance Corporation supported the construction of the largest wind farm in West Africa – a 158-megawatt power plant near Dakar. This project has helped two million people gain access to power for the first time – in addition to other economic benefits. President Sall and I will discuss how Senegal and other countries can explore future investment project ideas in partnership with the U.S..In addition, we will discuss how the multilateral development banks can help countries like Senegal tackle traditional development challenges and reduce poverty while also better addressing cross-border challenges like climate change, pandemics, and spillovers from fragility.I greatly appreciate that President Sall was able to travel to Washington for the U.S. – African Leaders Summit and for the opportunity to discuss how we strengthen our partnership with Africa, and with Senegal in particular."
216,,"December 15, 2022","Under President Biden’s new strategy for partnering with Africa, a guiding principle has been that we must engage African leaders and citizens to solve common global challenges.This partnership is particularly important as we face global economic headwinds – including the spillovers from Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine. As a result, developing countries and African countries, in particular, have faced serious challenges such as higher food, fertilizer and fuel costs.The United States is seeking to deepen our economic relationships with Africa. Zambia is an important bilateral partner and President Hichilema has shown strong leadership in advancing critical economic reforms, tackling corruption, and building a foundation for stronger growth and job creation.I look forward to talking about the important role of the international financial institutions in supporting Zambia’s economic recovery and growth. And I hope we also discuss how to overcome the shortfalls in quality infrastructure investments, including through the President’s Global Initiative on Infrastructure Investment and support from the Millennium Challenge Corporation.We will also discuss the need to address debt sustainability and the imperative to conclude a debt treatment for Zambia under the Common Framework as quickly as possible.I believe achieving fair burden sharing among all bilateral official and private creditors will be important for building credibility for this important initiative.I greatly appreciate that President Hichilema is able to travel to Washington and for the opportunity to exchange views on these and other topics, as we strengthen the already close relationship between the United States and Zambia."
217,,"December 9, 2022","WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement following the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2664, which establishes a humanitarian carveout across UN sanctions regimes:“I welcome the United Nations Security Council’s adoption of a groundbreaking Resolution to implement a standardized humanitarian carveout across UN sanctions regimes. This Resolution further enables the flow of legitimate humanitarian assistance supporting the basic human needs of vulnerable populations while continuing to deny resources to malicious actors. Sanctions are an essential tool to combat key threats across the globe, including money laundering and terrorist financing. At the same time, Treasury recognizes the potential for unintended consequences, which is why Treasury’s 2021 Sanctions Review strongly recommended implementing or otherwise streamlining humanitarian authorizations across sanctions programs, noting that the United States must lead global efforts to systematically address the challenges associated with conducting humanitarian activities. I am very proud of our efforts jointly with Ireland, our co-lead on this initiative at the United Nations, to bring this Resolution to reality, which will further strengthen the use of financial sanctions as an effective policy tool.The provision of legitimate humanitarian assistance to vulnerable populations reflects core American values. Treasury will continue to work with humanitarian organizations and their service providers as we build upon today’s Resolution to support their critical life-saving work.”"
218,,"December 8, 2022","Thank you for that kind introduction, Chief Malerba, and for the extraordinary job you are doing as our Treasurer. And good morning, everyone. I’m delighted to be in Fort Worth – and at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.Let me begin by thanking my BEP colleagues here today: for joining us and for all of your hard work. The currency that you produce here touches just about everyone in the United States and millions more across the world. Our currency is essential to the functioning of the financial system. And its integrity is core to our national security.BEP employees have always gone above and beyond. But you’ve done so at a whole new scale under heightened pressure over the past few years. When much of the nation was sheltering at home, most of you reported to work in person to run essential operations during the pandemic. You’ve worked overtime and on weekends to meet the historic demand for U.S. currency. And you did so successfully: on schedule and under budget.But that’s not all. As if these immediate needs weren’t enough of a challenge, many of you have dedicated time and energy to position BEP for the coming decades. You’ve made significant progress on our very ambitious plans to expand the Fort Worth facility and to build a new facility in Maryland. And most importantly, many of you are spending time to mentor and train the next generation of highly skilled union workers. Indeed, BEP benefits from over 1,200 dedicated union members.I want to thank you for all you are doing. Each of you is taking on so much. I know you take tremendous pride in your work. And I hope you know how appreciative I am of your work as well.I want to especially thank Director Len Olijar  Director Olijar is set to retire from federal service next month after nearly 35 years at BEP. Director: your dedication to BEP, Treasury, and our country epitomizes the spirit of public service. We’re grateful for your commitment to this organization – from when you were coming up the ranks of the Bureau to your many years at the helm.It’s no surprise why Director Olijar and many of you have spent your careers dedicated to the work of this organization. Currency plays a critical role in our economy. Economists know that money serves a number of traditional purposes: as a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. Put simply, our currency powers our economic engine. It enables people to exchange goods and services with each other more efficiently. But money also has a deeper social purpose. Currency is something we use and touch every day. When done right, it can tell us who we are, what we value, and what is possible.Some of the first banknotes issued by the Continental Congress included unifying messages like “we are one.” Coins in the 20thcentury featured national heroes like Susan B. Anthony. She was the first woman to appear on a circulating U.S. coin. This year, the Mint has rolled out coinage with the faces of five remarkable American women. That includes trailblazers like Maya Angelou, poet and civil rights activist, and Anna May Wong, Hollywood’s first Chinese-American film star. But these coins are just the beginning of our work to ensure our currency and coinage reflect the full fabric of our nation. With your hard work, we will be introducing new currency designs in the coming years – including placing Harriet Tubman’s portrait on the $20 bill.It’s customary that Treasury Secretaries provide their signature to be featured on our nation’s currency. You’d think this would be a straightforward process. But the founding fathers did not account for what seems to be a common attribute for Treasury Secretaries: terrible handwriting. My friend Tim Geithner famously had to change his signature in order to make it legible. In an interview back in 2012, he described that the change was made not for “elegance” but simply for “clarity.” President Obama joked during Jack Lew’s nomination as Secretary that he should try to make “at least one letter legible” in his signature. The good news is that President Biden did not make a similar request when he nominated me. But I’ll admit: I spent some quality time practicing my signature before submitting it to Director Olijar.In all seriousness: I’m honored that, thanks to the hard work of this team, the first banknotes with my signature are being delivered this month to the Federal Reserve. They’ll be in circulation starting in the new year. Some will note that this is the first time the signature of a woman Treasury Secretary will be on a U.S. banknote. And the first time the signatures of two women will be on our currency.But this is really not about me or Treasurer Malerba. To me, these notes represent the hard, ongoing work of the Treasury Department to strengthen our economy and advance our economic standing around the world. And it is also a reminder of the contributions of the women who have worked at Treasury and in the economics profession.When our Administration first entered office, the economy was in the depths of the COVID pandemic. The coronavirus was claiming more American lives a week than it had at any other point since the start of the pandemic. Millions of jobs had been lost. And there was tremendous uncertainty about the fate of our economy. In 2020 and 2021, we were facing the tail risk of an economic downturn that matched the Great Depression.Yet over the past two years, our country has seen a historic economic recovery. Treasury has been at the forefront of these efforts. Through the American Rescue Plan, we provided aid to households, businesses, and state and local governments to help them get through a once-in-a-century pandemic. This assistance saved American lives and kept families in their homes. And it provided critical financial relief to those who were suffering.At the same time, we have also made long-term investments in our economic strength.  The passage of the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act this year will enable the growth of two important industries of the future: semiconductors and clean energy. Nearly three-quarters – or $270 billion – of the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate investments are delivered via tax incentives. This puts Treasury at the forefront of implementing the biggest climate action in our nation’s history. The law will also position us to capitalize on a wave of economic opportunities for the American people, including in communities often overlooked. As we make these targeted investments, we are also improving our revenue collection system. We have secured much-needed long-term funding for the IRS. The surge of new resources will modernize the IRS and dramatically improve taxpayer service. And it will enable the agency to make sure that all Americans are playing by the same tax rules.As we’ve rescued and invested in our economy, we have also strengthened our financial system. In the face of increased market volatility, our financial system remains resilient and continues to operate well through uncertainties. Since the beginning of the Administration, Treasury has worked with financial regulators to improve the resiliency of the Treasury market. This market plays a critical role in supporting the global financial system and financing the federal government. We have also worked to reduce risks in financial firms and activities that operate outside – but are connected to – the traditionally regulated banking system. And we are addressing potential emerging risks to the financial system from climate change and digital assets. We will continue this work through 2023 and beyond.Beyond addressing our considerable domestic challenges, we’ve also advanced the economic interests of Americans around the world. Some of our biggest economic challenges are global. Today, the world economy faces serious headwinds in large part due to Putin’s barbaric war in Ukraine.When Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, the United States joined partners and allies to implement a historic sanctions regime to hold Russia accountable. Together with over 30 countries, we have denied Russia revenue and resources it needs to fight its war. We have also degraded Russia’s military-industrial complex and ability to wage war in the long term. Our efforts are working: we have curtailed Russia’s access to semiconductors and other key inputs. In fact, reports indicate that Russia is now forced to turn to outdated Soviet-era equipment and arms and technology from North Korea and Iran. Now, with our price cap on Russian oil in place, we are targeting Russia’s key source of revenue while aiming to mitigate volatility in global energy markets.In the meantime, the United States is supporting Ukrainians with $13 billion in direct economic assistance – in addition to military aid. And we’ve requested that Congress provide an additional $14.5 billion in support for the first nine months of 2023. Our support of Ukraine is a moral and national security imperative. And we’re continuing to help mitigate the impacts of Russia’s war on countries in need. Energy and food security is critical for countries around the world, in addition to our continued urgent work on poverty alleviation, pandemic response, and climate mitigation and adaptation. As I look back on the past year, I’m reminded of the talent and dedication of our Treasury colleagues. Our work is only possible because we are tapping into the potential of people with a broad range of backgrounds and experiences.The truth is that this wasn’t always the case for women in the economics profession. I was the only woman out of a PhD program of a couple dozen students. When I was at the start of my academic career, women made up only 6 percent of faculty in economic departments surveyed by the American Economic Association. And this was back in the early 1970s. Women who came before me – and even more so for those in less forgiving professions – experienced much worse.In fact, Treasury led the first major effort to employ women into the federal government. While Treasury hired a few women prior to the 19th century, there was no dedicated effort to do so until the Civil War. Men were in short supply, and women were cheaper to hire. So, starting in 1862, Treasury began hiring hundreds of women. The first woman to be hired in that cohort was Jennie Douglas. The first Black woman was Sophia Holmes. Many of these women were responsible for inspecting banknotes for counterfeits and cutting up sheets of Treasury notes. In other words, these women were your predecessors at BEP.Many decades later, President Franklin Roosevelt nominated Josephine Roche as the first woman to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. Women joined the Treasury workforce in much larger numbers in the 20th century, thanks to the persistent work of activists and women like Jennie, Sophia, and Josephine. They also did so in other industries and professions. In fact, the growing participation of women in our labor force was one of the greatest drivers of America’s economic growth in the 20th century.Today, women represent around 62 percent of the Treasury workforce. And women are in positions of power across our Department – from public affairs to domestic finance to the chief of staff’s office. We’ve made progress in providing greater economic opportunity for women at Treasury and in the economics profession. But we know that much more needs to be done. I hope that today is a reminder of the road we’ve traveled on equity and inclusion. And I hope it motivates us to continue to move forward.I’m proud of the work that Treasury is doing. Today is not about me or a new signature on our currency. It’s about our collective work to create a stronger and more inclusive economy. At the end of the day, the field of economics is not about numbers or theory. It’s about improving the lives of ordinary people. This is what the Treasury Department has been focused on in 2022. And that will continue to be our North Star over the coming months and years."
219,,"December 5, 2022","I’d like to thank you for being here today, and for the work that you’ve graciously agreed to do. The formation of this committee is a milestone in Treasury’s racial equity agenda. This committee will bring a wide set of outside perspectives to advise me, the Deputy Secretary, and other Treasury officials on how we can bolster our equity efforts.The inaugural members of the committee come from a broad range of backgrounds – from academia to business to local government. But you all share a commitment to building an economy that works for everyone. I want to thank Mayor Nutter for chairing this committee, and Felicia Wong for serving as vice chair. And I want to thank Janis Bowdler, my Counselor for Racial Equity, and her team for their hard work.Since taking office, President Biden has made clear that our Administration’s work to recover and rebuild must be inclusive and equitable. Even before the coronavirus hit our shores, we knew our economy had not worked as well as it should for too many people of color. And we knew that this did not just have a negative impact on underserved communities. Economic inequality is a drag on our economy as a whole.In fact, I have spent the last few months on the road to lay out our “modern supply-side” agenda. This agenda – reflected in the President’s economic plan – recognizes that some of the best opportunities for growth come from investing in people and places that have been overlooked. I believe that investments in disadvantaged communities often result in higher relative returns on investment. And they can boost top-line growth by enabling us to tap all our resources.At Treasury, we have been guided by this principle in our work. Our first job was to foster a post-pandemic recovery that did not leave any Americans behind. We centered equity in our implementation of the American Rescue Plan – from our housing programs to our aid to state and local governments. Today, economic data indicates that our recovery has been the most equitable in recent history, with record drops in unemployment for many communities of color.We are also making investments that will drive the future growth of our economy. Over the past year, the Biden Administration has made three historic investments in the long-term strength of our economy: the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act. Treasury is playing a particularly significant role in the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act’s historic climate change investments – nearly three-quarters of which are estimated to be delivered via tax incentives. You’ll hear an update today from Lily Batchelder, our Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, about our efforts there. And you’ll also hear from Counselor Natasha Sarin about our efforts to modernize the IRS and ensure that allThe Treasury Advisory Committee on Racial Equity will play a major role in our effort. Over the coming months, you will inform our policymaking in areas from tax fairness and capital delivery systems to Treasury’s internal efforts to reflect America’s diversity in our workforce. And you’ll keep us accountable: to make sure we’re focused on our North Star of fostering an economy that unlocks everyone’s economic potential – including people of color, rural communities and those most affected by climate change. Our entire economy benefits when all Americans reach their full potential.The work of this committee will make a difference for many Americans. I’m looking forward to hearing your perspectives in this meeting. And I’m looking forward to working together to ensure communities of color and other underserved communities benefit from – and participate in – the economic growth and investments enacted by this Administration."
220,,"December 2, 2022","“Together, the G7, European Union, and Australia have now jointly set a cap on the price of seaborne Russian oil that will help us achieve our goal of restricting Putin’s primary source of revenue for his illegal war in Ukraine while simultaneously preserving the stability of global energy supplies. Today’s announcement is the culmination of months of effort by our coalition, and I commend the hard work of our partners in achieving this outcome.The price cap will encourage the flow of discounted Russian oil onto global markets and is designed to help protect consumers and businesses from global supply disruptions. The price cap will particularly benefit low- and medium-income countries who have already borne the brunt of elevated energy and food prices exacerbated by Putin’s war. Whether these countries purchase energy inside or outside of the cap, the cap will enable them to bargain for steeper discounts on Russian oil and benefit from greater stability in global energy markets.Today’s action will also help further constrain Putin’s finances and limit the revenues he’s using to fund his brutal invasion. With Russia’s economy already contracting and its budget increasingly stretched thin, the price cap will immediately cut into Putin’s most important source of revenue.I look forward to further close coordination with our allies on implementation of the price cap, and on our united efforts against Russia’s unprovoked aggression.”"

223,,"November 16, 2022","""The recent failure of a major cryptocurrency exchange and the unfortunate impact that has resulted for holders and investors of crypto assets demonstrate the need for more effective oversight of cryptocurrency markets.Over the past year, through the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets and in response to the President’s Executive Order on Digital Assets, the Treasury Department worked with its regulatory partners to identify risks in crypto markets.  Some of the risks we identified in these reports, including comingling of customer assets, lack of transparency, and conflicts of interest, were at the center of the crypto market stresses observed over the past week.We have very strong investor and consumer protection laws for most of our financial products and markets that are designed to address these risks.  Where existing regulations apply, they must be enforced rigorously so that the same protections and principles apply to crypto assets and services.  The federal government, including Congress, also needs to move quickly to fill the regulatory gaps the Biden Administration has identified.  In terms of financial stability, spillovers from the events in crypto markets have been limited, but a recent report by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which Treasury chairs, warned that further interconnections of the traditional financial system and crypto markets could raise broader financial stability concerns. Going forward, it’s vital we do what is necessary to address these concerning risks and act to protect consumers and promote financial stability."""

225,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
226,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
227,,"November 21, 2023",
228,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
229,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1. For additional analysis on Treasury market liquidity conditions, see (for example): “Resilience redux in the Treasury Market” by Darrell Duffie (August 25, 2023) and “How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Evolved in 2023” by Michael Fleming (October 17, 2023).2. Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

230,,"November 16, 2022","To begin, I’d like to acknowledge yesterday’s wave of horrific Russian missile attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian targets. Our thoughts go out to the people of Ukraine.I want to extend my congratulations to you on your appointment as Minister. I hope that Italy’s transition to new leadership remains smooth as you continue the difficult work to secure Italy’s economic recovery.Italy has long been an important ally of the United States. I value our partnership on global economic issues, and I am particularly appreciative of our cooperation on sanctions to hold Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine.Russia’s barbaric war has destroyed lives and livelihoods in Ukraine. But its ramifications have also reached millions around the globe – including threatening energy supply in Europe.As I’ve said before, ending Russia’s war is a moral imperative. And it remains the single best thing we can do to help the global economy. Both of our countries are committed to holding Russia accountable for its horrific actions – and we must support brave Ukrainians as they defend their homeland and rebuild.I look forward to discussing a range of issues with you today, including continuing to hold Russia accountable, supporting Ukraine financing and recovery, and building sustainable global growth.In particular, I’m proud that yesterday the Biden Administration requested a further $14.5 billion, which will primarily provide economic assistance to Ukraine for the first 9 months of 2023. In addition to the European Union’s recent commitment of 18 billion euros in economic support for 2023, and the significant economic and security assistance our countries have already provided, we are ensuring that the Ukrainian people have the support they need to resist Russia’s illegal war of aggression."
231,,"November 15, 2022","WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen issued the following statement on the Biden- Harris Administration’s request for emergency supplemental funding for critical assistance to Ukraine.“Today, the Biden-Harris Administration once again reaffirmed the United States’ unwavering support for Ukraine through an additional $14.5 billion supplemental request, which will primarily provide critical economic assistance to Ukraine for the first nine months of 2023. This support will help Ukraine mitigate the effects of Russia’s brutal and illegal war, in addition to bolstering energy and cyber security in the region and promoting global food security.  Ukraine faces significant financing needs to maintain essential government services and provide relief for the Ukrainian people, invest in critical infrastructure projects, and secure its energy demands.  The United States has been a leading partner to Ukraine— committing over $13 billion in economic assistance grants since the start of the war in addition to security assistance — and will continue to support the Government of Ukraine and its people as they bravely defend themselves against Russian aggression.  I welcome commitments from Ukraine’s allies and partners and call on them to step up and expedite additional financial support to Ukraine, particularly in the form of grants.  The Department of Treasury will also continue to employ all available tools to hold Russian authorities responsible for their illegal actions in Ukraine, including through sanctions that are denying Russia the military equipment they need to wage this illegal war, and through the price cap, which will cut into a primary source of Russia’s revenue while supporting stable energy supplies.”"
232,,"November 13, 2022","We’re meeting at a difficult time for the world economy, which is in large part the result of Russia’s war against Ukraine and the lingering impacts of the pandemic in many countries.Russia’s barbaric war has destroyed lives and livelihoods in Ukraine. But its ramifications have also reached millions around the globe – including threatening energy supply in Europe.The global situation makes the partnership between France and the United States particularly crucial. Both of our countries are staunchly committed to holding Russia accountable for its horrific actions – and we must support brave Ukrainians as they defend their homeland and rebuild.We’re doing so with security assistance, budget support, and a wide range of sanctions. In addition, we’re working closely with each other – and the rest of the G7 – to implement a cap on the price of Russian oil. This policy will put downward pressure on global energy prices while reducing revenues that the Kremlin can use to fund its war.Minister Le Maire, I am looking forward to discussing our work to hold Russia accountable – along with a range of other issues, such as supporting Ukraine financing and recovery, where our cooperation will be critical."
233,,"November 11, 2022","Good morning. Let me start by thanking Microsoft for hosting me. I’m appreciative of your warm welcome and the opportunity to meet with private sector executives and engineers this morning. Your work is helping strengthen our countries’ ties and contributing to our economic growth.This is my first visit to India as Treasury Secretary. I’m delighted to be here as India celebrates its 75th year of independence and prepares to assume the G20 presidency. As President Biden said earlier this year, India is one of America’s indispensable partners. The dynamism I’ve felt at Microsoft today – and in Delhi more broadly – is a testament to the talent of the Indian people and the vibrancy of its culture. It’s no surprise that India is among the fastest-growing major economies in the world.I’m also here at a pivotal moment for the global economy. We are dealing with a confluence of headwinds: the lingering effects of the pandemic, spillovers from Putin’s barbaric war in Ukraine, and macroeconomic tightening as many countries grapple with inflation. Emerging markets and developing countries are particularly under pressure. Tens of millions more people face extreme poverty and hunger since Russia’s war in Ukraine began. Prime Minister Modi was correct when he said that this “is not an era of war.” I believe that ending Russia’s war is a moral imperative. It is also the single best thing we can do to help the global economy. This is a view that is broadly shared among policymakers of the world’s major economies.I’ll begin my remarks today by discussing the strong relationship between our two countries. I’ll focus particularly on efforts to deepen our shared economic interests, including through trade. Our collective work is critical to showing the world that democracies can deliver for our people.Then, I’ll turn to our leadership on global priorities. The trajectory of the global economy will be shaped by the work that India and the United States undertake together. The same is true for the prosperity and security of the Indo-Pacific. As a lead developing country and the world’s largest economy, we have great opportunity and great responsibility to make progress on the world’s most intractable problems. In fact, I think that our continued partnership is an example of how advanced and developing countries can bridge policy differences and move forward on major policy objectives.The U.S.-India relationship continues to grow through its 75th year. Our ties are stronger than ever before. The United States is home to the largest Indian diaspora outside of Asia. It serves as India’s largest export market. Bilateral trade between our two countries reached an all-time high last year, and we expect it to grow further in the years to come. The dynamism of our relationship can especially be seen in the technology sector. Our people and our companies depend on each other on a daily basis. Indians frequently use WhatsApp to communicate; many American companies rely on Infosys to operate. Leaders of Indian descent populate the highest ranks of Google, Microsoft, and other valuable American companies. They’re also responsible for starting a third of all immigrant-founded startups in the United States.Domestically, both of our countries are pursuing long-term investments in our economic strength. Since the Biden Administration took office last year, we have enacted an agenda that I call “modern supply-side” economics. This agenda pursues investments in human capital, physical capital, and science and technology in order to boost the economy’s productive capacity and reduce inequality. I know that India shares an interest in certain elements of this agenda as well. Prime Minister Modi has launched a 100-trillion-rupee infrastructure development plan, just as President Biden is deploying funding from our historic $1.2 trillion infrastructure law. Both of our countries are also growing our domestic semiconductor and clean energy industries. The United States welcomes India’s ambition to become a powerhouse in the areas of green hydrogen and other renewable technologies like solar.More broadly, India and the United States are the world’s largest democracies. We are living at a critical time for the cause of freedom around the world. Democracies require our constant attention and nurturing. It is important for all democracies to renew our commitment to civil liberties and human rights, including for all our minorities, at home and abroad. And we must continue to cultivate the economic vitality that is tied to our democratic traditions. That’s an open, inclusive, and competitive economy where new ideas can grow and thrive, with the stability and reliability accorded by adherence to the rule of law.In the Indo-Pacific region, our shared objective is to advance prosperity and maintain peace and security. India and the United States remain committed to upholding the rules-based international order. We are working with our allies and partners to tackle global challenges through the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The United States’ leadership in establishing IPEF demonstrates our commitment to the region. Together, the 14 members of IPEF constitute 40 percent of the world’s GDP. We are writing new rules for the 21st-century economy, in areas from climate to anti-corruption to supply chain resilience.This brings me to my next point. The United States and India share an interest in strengthening our supply chains in a world where certain governments wield trade as a geopolitical weapon. Let me explain an approach that the United States is taking to minimize supply chain vulnerabilities. It’s called “friendshoring.”Let’s begin with the basics. The United States believes in economic integration. Trade can drive growth and bring significant economic benefits to all countries involved. Exports enable countries to expand production and provide good-paying jobs in industries where they have a comparative advantage. Imports provide consumers and businesses with cheaper goods and a broader array of choices. Trade also facilitates the cross-pollination of ideas that is vital to discovery and innovation.We must vigorously promote our global economic integration and continue to reap its benefits. As we do so, I believe that we must also account for the probability of disruptions to trade. Recent disruptions have contributed to higher prices in both of our countries and sapped economic output. For too long, countries around the world have been overly dependent on risky countries or a single source for critical inputs.Take Russian energy exports. Russia has long presented itself as a reliable energy partner. But for the better part of this year, Putin has weaponized Russia’s natural gas supply against the people of Europe. It’s an example of how malicious actors can use their market positions to try to gain geopolitical leverage or disrupt trade for their own gain.The United States is pursuing an approach called “friendshoring” to diversify away from countries that present geopolitical and security risks to our supply chain. To do so, we are proactively deepening economic integration with trusted trading partners like India. Our strategy will also create redundancies in our supply chain to mitigate over-concentration risks. And we are also addressing our reliance on manufacturers whose approaches clash with our human rights values.To be very clear, friendshoring is not limited to an exclusive club of countries. We seek integration with the large group of countries that we can count on – developing countries and advanced economies alike. In fact, part of our “friendshoring” approach involves partnering with developing countries to grow local industries and connect them to the global supply chain. For example, our development finance institution is providing America’s largest solar manufacturer with up to $500 million in debt financing to build a facility in Tamil Nadu in India. This facility will boost India’s solar manufacturing capacity. At the same time, it will help diversify supply chains away from China, which currently dominates over 80 percent of global solar panel production. Our investments are also consistent with our values: certain solar panel materials produced in China – like those from the Xinjiang region – are known to be produced with forced labor.We are already seeing progress. New supply chains are developing across regions from Asia to the European Union. We are also seeing signs that Western firms are diversifying their supply chains beyond China. Technology companies like Amazon and Google are investing in India and Vietnam. Apple recently announced that it was shifting some iPhone manufacturing from China to India. The United States will continue to deepen our business and commercial ties with India as we pursue our friendshoring agenda.Building a truly resilient world also requires multilateral action on pressing global challenges. We know these problems are urgent. And we know how reliant we are on each other. A virus that emerges in a city on one side of the world can spread into a pandemic. An unjustified land war in one region can worsen hunger and poverty for millions around the globe.In three weeks, India will assume the helm of the G20 at an uncertain time for the global economy. We look forward to supporting India’s G20 presidency. A successful Indian presidency is indispensable to our global economic recovery and sustained progress on our deepest problems.Let me focus on four shared objectives: addressing debt distress, promoting climate action, evolving the multilateral development banks, and embracing and shaping our changing economy.Even before the pandemic hit, debt levels were rising in many low- and middle-income countries. Today, nearly 60 percent of low-income countries are at high risk of or are in debt distress. This over-indebtedness poses a risk to stability and growth at a time when financial pressures are mounting. Without timely and orderly debt relief, we worry that many developing countries may face severe economic fallout.India’s G20 year is a chance to accelerate global coordination on debt restructuring. Two years ago, the G20 established the Common Framework to bring all the major bilateral creditors together to coordinate timely and orderly debt relief for low-income countries. But the Common Framework has not delivered on its promise, largely because of lack of cooperation from China. As a consequence, debtor countries in need are hesitant to request Common Framework treatment. This needs to change. All major bilateral creditors, including China, must cooperate constructively to deliver on their G20 commitment to provide meaningful debt relief. We must also improve the speed and predictability of the Common Framework itself.Beyond low-income countries, middle-income countries in distress, such as Sri Lanka, will also need a process for receiving timely and orderly debt relief. We welcome India’s leadership in this area, whether through an expansion of the Common Framework or another multilateral frameworkAs the world’s second- and third-largest emitters, we have a shared interest and responsibility to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. The United States is taking significant action. At home, we have enacted the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s the most aggressive domestic climate action in our history. Our investment puts us on a strong path to meet our goal of reducing our emissions to at least half of 2005 levels by the end of this decade. It will also bring down the cost curves of clean energy technologies. This will have positive spillovers for the rest of the world. Abroad, we are supporting the clean energy transition for developing countries, all while recognizing that energy access remains a challenge for many. We are working with countries to strengthen climate resilience for the most vulnerable communities. And we are facilitating a just transition for those most affected by the shift to a net-zero economy.President Biden has committed to increasing U.S. international public climate financing to over $11 billion by 2024. In partnership with India, the G7 is marshalling a broad mix of public, private, and philanthropic financing to expedite India’s energy transition in line with its ambitious climate goals. We will also advance global climate coordination with India in our role as co-chair of the G20 working group on sustainable finance. A global challenge like climate cannot be solved by any one country. It requires all of us to work together.The world faces a growing array of increasingly complex and interlinked challenges that do not respect national boundaries. This includes climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict. Yet, our existing multilateral development finance architecture is currently unable to respond to these global challenges with the necessary speed and scale. Last month, ahead of the Annual Meetings, I called for an evolution of the development banks. I said that these institutions must devise new approaches to global challenges, while maintaining their existing focus on poverty reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals.I am pleased that the World Bank has committed to developing a work program by the end of the year to strengthen its role and capacity to respond to evolving needs. As key World Bank shareholders, India and the United States are critical to guiding the institution through this evolution. This effort serves as an important part of our overall strategy to mobilize against our global challenges.The digital revolution has changed the face of communication and commerce in our countries over the past three decades. Today, the digital economy provides massive opportunity and continues to drive economic growth. This is particularly true in India, which has over 560 million Internet subscribers and 1.2 billion mobile phone subscribers. Rapid digital adoption has enabled India to achieve stunning success on its financial inclusion efforts. Nearly 500 million new bank accounts have been opened in India over the past eight years. But the digital opportunities available to many Indians and Americans today are not readily available for much of the world. Around 3 billion citizens – more than a third of the world’s population – have never used the Internet. By extension, they are being entirely left out of the modern economy. Over the next five years, the G7 aims to mobilize $600 billion through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. It has identified digital infrastructure as a key priority alongside climate, health, and gender. The United States is ready to work with India and other partners to close the global digital gap. As we do so, it is equally important to combat threats to privacy and cybersecurity and attend to emerging problems like illicit finance.It is also clear that economic integration in the 21st century requires a modern international payments system. Cross-border payments should be cheaper than they are today. They should also be faster, more transparent, and easier to access. The G20 has set out a roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments. We look forward to working with India to deliver on tangible outcomes. This includes reducing frictions to the flow of data. We also look forward to the G20 advancing financial inclusion efforts for the unbanked around the world.In sum, we live in difficult and complicated times. We face urgent problems that require concerted and collective action. The work of our two countries has never been more vital. I believe that no significant global issue can be solved without the cooperation of our two countries. Our partnership can shape the lives of millions around the world.The U.S. and India are “natural allies,” in the words of a former Indian prime minister. We may be located across the world from each other, but what unites us is far greater than any of our differences. Our fights for independence were born of the same desire for freedom and dignity. And today, our democracies, while works in progress, are necessary bulwarks at a time of volatility and war.I believe that this moment is an inflection point not only for the global economy but for the democratic idea itself. People around the world are looking to us and asking: can democracies meet the economic needs of their citizens? Can they stand up to bullies and cooperate on the most intractable global problems? Or are democracies too messy and complex – and turn inward when the going gets tough?We have an opportunity to answer the skeptics. Democracy exhibits its greatest promise during turbulent times, when it serves not only as a system of governance but also as a reason for hope of collective progress. Our actions over the next year and beyond can demonstrate the capacity of our democracies to deliver for our people. I am confident that we will succeed."
234,,"November 11, 2022","Thank you for that introduction. It’s great to be here with all of you. Let me first express my thanks to Minister Sitharaman. I’m grateful for her warm welcome. I’m also appreciative of her partnership on a broad range of important issues over the past two years.I’m thrilled to be back in India. During this trip, I’ve been reminded of the dynamism of the Indian people. The leaders gathered here today are an example of the vitality that makes India one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world. It’s also been inspiring to witness how Americans and Indians are working together to strengthen our ties and drive economic growth for both of our countries.We’re meeting today at a moment where we see significant challenges for the global economy. The pandemic continues to exert a drag on economies across the globe. Putin’s brutal war has claimed countless Ukrainian lives and livelihoods; it has also exacerbated food and energy insecurity across the world. Climate change continues to devastate communities with greater severity and frequency.As President Biden said earlier this year, India is an indispensable partner to the United States. That’s particularly true today. I believe that these urgent challenges are bringing India and the United States closer together than ever before. Our partnership is especially crucial as India prepares to assume the G20 presidency. Over the next year, we look forward to supporting India’s presidency and making progress on our shared global priorities.But today, I want to focus on our own bilateral economic relationship. I believe that we should strengthen trade and investment between India and the United States. Deepening our bilateral ties will reap significant economic benefits for both of our nations. At a time of global turmoil, I also believe that it will bolster our countries’ resilience and national security.The economic ties between the U.S. and India are stronger than ever before. As you know, the United States is India’s biggest trading partner. And our bilateral trade recently reached an all-time high of over $150 billion in 2021. Direct investment from India in my country supported over 70,000 jobs at the end of 2020. A broad range of American companies – from Whirlpool to Boeing to GE – invest in India. And Indian technology firms like Infosys and Mindtree are critical to the day-to-day operations of many American corporations.Our close ties also extend to the next generation. We’re grateful that 200,000 Indians are studying in America and enriching our schools and universities. As many of you know, our strong educational and research collaboration will lay the groundwork for future economic growth.Our relationship has not only withstood, but thrived, at a time of global volatility. That’s no surprise. Our countries share an economic dynamism that is tied to our democratic traditions: one that values new ideas while providing stability and predictability through the rule of law.As we look to the future, I believe that the recent disruptions caused by the pandemic and Russia’s war are a reason to further deepen our economic ties.India is one of our trusted trading partners. In a world where supply chain vulnerabilities can impose heavy costs, we believe it’s important to strengthen our trade ties with India and the large number of countries that share our approach to economic relations. This includes both developing and advanced economies. Our goal is to vigorously promote global economic integration while creating greater redundancies in our supply chain to mitigate concentration risks. We also want to diversify away from risky countries like Russia that seek to weaponize trade integration to advance their geopolitical aims. We call this strategy “friendshoring.” Modernizing our trade relationships in this way will pay dividends. Increased trade between our two countries can result in economic benefits for our people. It will also provide greater reliability and certainty for consumers and businesses on key goods and inputs. As Prime Minister Modi said, resilient trade in the 21st century requires trust, transparency, and timeliness. Deepening our integration will serve all three of these goals.We are already seeing new supply chains develop in India. This includes manufacturing investments by American companies. Apple and Google have both announced plans to expand phone production in India. Hasbro, an American toy conglomerate, began shifting manufacturing from China to India and Vietnam in 2019. And it plans to continue doing so. We will continue to build business and commercial ties through meetings like the U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue and CEO Forum.Further, our government is partnering with India to grow local industries and connect them to global supply chains. We believe our investments will benefit both countries. For example, the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation has a very active portfolio in India – investing in projects from microfinance to renewable energy. Last year, it approved up to $500 million in debt financing for America’s largest solar manufacturer to build a solar module production facility in Tamil Nadu. The loan is the largest single debt financing transaction in the institution’s history. Once finished, the facility will strengthen global supply chains by diversifying solar panel production. At the same time, it will support Prime Minister Modi’s renewable energy ambitions.As we bolster our relationship, we can do so in a way that sets the standard for innovation and cooperation in the 21st century. Earlier this year, India and a dozen other economies joined the United States in establishing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The Indo-Pacific region is projected to be the largest contributor to global growth over the next few decades. The countries in this Framework will help write rules for our new economy.In all, I believe that the current moment, difficult as it is, will bring our countries even closer together. We have much to gain: for our economies as well as for our resilience and national security.All of us in this room have a critical role to play. We look forward to working with government, industry, and civil society leaders as we deepen the relationship between our two countries."

Hello, everyone. I’d first like to thank Ethan and his team for hosting me. And thank you for letting me take part in the opening of your new center today. The work you are doing shows how we can build on our strong manufacturing roots to create a brighter future in America. With this new space, MAGNET is helping to incubate the next generation of innovators. It’s also exposing thousands of students to the good-paying manufacturing jobs that our economy is creating.I’m glad to be in Ohio. It’s a fitting place to discuss our Administration’s efforts to strengthen the American economy and the manufacturing sector. Ohio is a birthplace of new American industries. It’s home to the Wright Brothers, who invented the first airplane. And Charles Kettering, the Dayton resident who created the world’s first automobile electric ignition. Even Thomas Edison was born just an hour from here.During my two years as Treasury Secretary, I have been laser focused on two economic priorities. First: rescuing the economy from the depths of the pandemic and stabilizing it amid additional global economic shocks. And second: strengthening the foundations of our post-pandemic economy. Our economic plan – powered by three major laws enacted over the past year – constitutes among the most significant investments that we’ve ever made in the long-term strength of our economy.Today, I will focus my remarks on President Biden’s economic plan, and how it will create resilient growth and an economy that works for all Americans. I’ll talk specifically about the core role of American manufacturing in our agenda. Over the past two years, our Administration has made significant investments in our country’s industrial strength. These investments will create good-paying jobs, make our economy more productive and resilient, and ensure that economic opportunity is shared broadly beyond our country’s coasts.At the time of the President’s inauguration in January 2021, the United States was in the depths of the pandemic. The virus was claiming more American lives a week than it had at any other point since the onset of the crisis. The economic calamity was also massive. Over 800,000 new jobless claims were being filed in an average week. Given the severity of the economic downturn, our Administration took action: to support households, businesses, and state and local governments through a once-in-a-century public health emergency.Two years later, we have experienced one of the quickest economic recoveries in modern history. Since President Biden took office, we have created over 10 million jobs. Manufacturing jobs are growing at their fastest pace since the 1980s. Nearly 700,000 manufacturing jobs have been added since early last year. And we’ve seen significant investments in American manufacturing, including right here in Ohio.While these are promising signs, we still face challenges. Today, our economy faces high inflation and significant global headwinds. Americans are rightly concerned that rising prices are eroding their living standards, so our Administration’s top economic priority is to bring inflation down. But even in the face of these challenges, our economy remains resilient, bolstered by President Biden’s economic plan. That resilience is evidenced by today’s GDP report, which shows solid real GDP growth in our economy in the third quarter. We are seeing ample signs of America’s economic strength, despite global challenges like the impact of Putin’s illegal war and successive waves of COVID. Our unemployment rate is at its lowest point in over 50 years. Household balance sheets remain strong. These signals are consistent with an economy that is shifting from a historically fast recovery to stable and sustained growth.As our Administration continues to tackle our immediate challenges, we have also been focused on strengthening the long-term foundations of the American economy. I will now turn to the three pillars of our economic plan: expanding our productive capacity, bolstering our economic resilience, and creating an economy that works for all.
 Earlier this year, I delivered a speech calling for a “modern supply-side” expansion of our economy. With a labor market at full employment, I argued that the current moment was well-suited for a supply-side agenda that increases our economy’s productive capacity. A country’s long-term growth potential depends on, among other things, how many people we have working and the productivity of our workers. Concerted investments in both areas increase the ceiling for what our economy can produce.Less than a year later, I’m proud to report that we’ve enacted key parts of our “modern supply-side” agenda. There are three major laws powering our growth strategy. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is modernizing our nation’s physical and digital infrastructure. I’ll speak more to that in a moment. The CHIPS Act is growing semiconductor manufacturing here at home. And the Inflation Reduction Act is our nation’s largest-ever investment in clean energy – and will bolster America’s leadership in the industries of the future for years to come.Economic research has long established that investment in basic infrastructure increases productivity, attracts business activity, and is associated with higher rates of economic growth. Put simply, good infrastructure makes it easier to make things in America and ship our products to the world. Better freight rail allows goods to move from Point A to Point B with fewer disruptions. Modern roads, bridges, and public transportation help connect workers with training, education, and better jobs. Expanding our electric grid and broadband infrastructure help lay the foundations for modern industries like clean energy and digital technology.Our economic plan invests in everything I just mentioned. But we also know that it’s not enough just to fund infrastructure. We need to accelerate the pace at which we deploy these projects in order to maximize the economic benefits. This month, our Administration announced an Action Plan to efficiently deliver infrastructure that is “On Time, On Task, and On Budget.”[1] We are advancing our Permitting Action Plan to speed up investments while upholding bedrock standards and laws. We are also working with employers, labor unions, and training providers to build a robust talent pipeline of skilled workers in sectors like construction and electrification.In sum, our investments in infrastructure will boost our economic potential. They will help build on the progress we’ve made in American manufacturing. They will also help our economy cope with unexpected shocks – like pandemics or climate disasters. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed immense disruptions in our lives. The confluence of the pandemic’s economic effects, climate disasters, and Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine have driven food and energy price volatility and created shortages in some of our most critical goods. Our Administration is building resilience to such future shocks by strengthening our supply chains and growing critical manufacturing industries in America.Semiconductors have been a major area of focus. These microchips power so much of modern life: from phones to cars to washing machines. They also power technologies that are crucial to our national defense.The United States is a leader in certain parts of the semiconductor ecosystem – like chip design. But we’ve lost our leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. Three decades ago, the United States made 37 percent of semiconductors sold globally. Today, we produce only 12 percent. When it comes to the most advanced chips, we have no meaningful manufacturing capacity at all.Semiconductors are so critical that China, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union have – or are about to – invest in growing their domestic manufacturing capacity.[2] The economic stakes are high. The pandemic chip shortage resulted in a loss of about $240 billion in U.S. GDP last year.[3] Here in Ohio, the shortage caused automakers like Ford to temporarily shut down their assembly plants.[4]Our economic plan is nurturing the growth of the full semiconductor ecosystem in the United States: from R&D to design to fabrication. Tens of billions of dollars will go toward growing domestic semiconductor manufacturing in America. We believe that this will reduce economic and national security risks. It will provide greater certainty to both businesses and consumers. And it will also build our leadership in areas like R&D; close collaboration between “lab” and “fab” is necessary to directing R&D efforts based on what works on the factory floor.There’s already been progress. Major manufacturers are expanding their U.S. footprint. Just last month, Intel broke ground on its $20 billion semiconductor plant outside of Columbus.[5] Intel’s project is said to be the single largest private investment in Ohio’s history. When completed, it will employ thousands of Ohioans and support tens of thousands of additional long-term jobs throughout the ecosystem. We are already seeing reverberating effects of this investment on local communities. For example, Intel is investing $50 million in Ohio colleges and universities to help train the next generation of chipmakers.[6]Our semiconductor investments demonstrate that government and business can work together to nurture and grow new industries. It also demonstrates that we can work together to broaden economic opportunity and create good-paying jobs. In fact, a deliberate feature of our “modern supply-side” agenda is the allocation of investments across people and places – particularly those that are historically underserved.For too long, regions like the Midwest have suffered through decades of underinvestment. Wages for too many working families have stagnated. At the same time, providing for basic needs and investing in their kids’ futures have become increasingly expensive. The costs of childcare, healthcare, buying a home, and higher education have risen faster than median household income over the past three decades.The traditional approach to supply-side economics focuses on generating economic growth through deregulation and tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans and large corporations. Economic evidence indicates that this strategy has failed to achieve its promised gains. In many cases, it has also exacerbated income and wealth inequality.In contrast, our “modern supply-side” agenda recognizes that investing in underserved communities is not just good for the community itself. It’s good for the whole economy. Given the economic premise of diminishing returns, we believe that investments in underserved communities have higher relative returns on investment. They also help unlock the potential of all Americans. That expands our economic capacity.A prime example is investing in small manufacturers, including those in underserved communities. Treasury recently approved Ohio to receive up to $182 million in small business funding through the State Small Business Credit Initiative. This American Rescue Plan program is expected to mobilize up to ten times the amount of public funding – through private capital – to support small businesses across the country, including small manufacturers. During the prior version of this program, Ohio generated over $28 million in support to small manufacturers.We are beginning to see signs of renewal in places and sectors that have traditionally seen disinvestment. American manufacturing employment had dropped precipitously over the past few decades. In Ohio, people employed in manufacturing jobs fell from a million in 2000 – to less than 700,000 twenty years later – even as Ohio’s population grew. But our Administration’s manufacturing incentives have recently led to a wave of private sector commitments that will power our economy and create good-paying jobs. Clean energy industries have been shown to create broad opportunity across the country, including in non-coastal areas and communities traditionally reliant on fossil fuel extraction. In fact, the Inflation Reduction Act provides businesses with bonus tax incentives for investing in low-income and energy communities. This is a place-based investment strategy designed to broaden economic opportunity across all communities.Since January of last year, companies have announced over $100 billion in EV, battery, and charging investments here in America.[7] Honda and LG earlier this month announced a battery plant in Fayette County – right outside Columbus.[8] This plant will create thousands of new jobs. The wave of new battery investments in the Midwest has been so significant that some commentators are dubbing the region as the new “Battery Belt.”[9] We expect to see our economic plan continue to drive a significant amount of capital into good clean energy and manufacturing jobs over the coming months and years.As we create an economy that works for all Americans, we also know economic fairness requires all Americans to play by the same rules. Too often, that has not been the case in our tax system.We currently have a two-tiered tax system: one where average families pay their fair share while large corporations and high-income earners too often do not. Take the “tax gap.” That’s the amount of taxes owed but not paid to the IRS. In 2019, the top one percent of Americans was estimated to owe over a fifth of unpaid taxes – a total of around $160 billion.[10]Much of the disparity stemmed from chronic underinvestment in the IRS. This was unacceptable to the President and me. So, we secured $80 billion of new funding for the agency.This funding will enable the IRS to increase audits of taxpayers at the high end who have not paid their full bill. As I’ve said before, I’ve directed that enforcement resources will not be used to raise audit rates for households making under $400,000 a year relative to historical levels. In fact, once the IRS has the right technological infrastructure in place, we expect audit rates for honest taxpayers to decline.By closing the tax gap, we will raise hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue over this decade. Our corporate tax reforms – like the 15 percent minimum tax on the largest corporations – will raise hundreds of billions more as well. The additional revenue will strengthen our public finances. It can be used to fund additional investments in our economic strength, lower the deficit, or reduce taxes for working families.I believe that these tax reforms reflect the values underpinning our entire economic plan: that economic fairness actually adds to, rather than subtracts from, our overall economic strength.When we look back decades from now, I believe that we will view the past two years as a uniquely difficult time for our country and the world. We’ve gone through so much together: a pandemic, a war in Europe, and an acceleration of climate disasters. There’s much more we must do to ease the strain on working families. But I believe that we will also view this period as a time when we renewed America’s economic strength. We are positioning America to build, innovate, and lead in the 21st century."

Thank you all for joining me today. This is the second of six roundtables we are hosting on the Inflation Reduction Act’s climate and clean energy tax incentives.
 
I am looking forward to hearing from you about how we can accelerate the build-out of a clean energy economy.
 
As you know, the Inflation Reduction Act is the most significant investment in clean energy in our nation’s history. It puts President Biden’s climate goals within reach. At the same time, it creates jobs, saves households money, and strengthens our nation’s energy security. 
 
To realize the promise of this law, we are working in tandem with all of you: utilities, project developers, manufacturers, organized labor, community organizations, and other critical actors who help supply the clean power our economy and our planet need. 
 
As you all know, the Inflation Reduction Act provides the long-term clarity that clean energy developers have sought for years. We’d like to hear from you about how our guidance can help provide further certainty so that investments can move forward and our economy can realize the benefits as quickly as possible. 
 
The law also includes several new provisions for clean energy tax incentives, including wage and apprenticeship bonuses, bonuses for investing in low-income communities and energy communities, bonuses for using domestic content, additional support for the clean energy value chain, and new ways to monetize credits. 
 
We welcome your insights on how to promote an efficient and effective implementation of these and other aspects of the law.
 
I appreciate your partnership, and I’m grateful for all the work you’ve already done to accelerate the deployment of clean energy. We look forward to continued engagement with you all in the months ahead.
 
Thank you very much.  "
238,,"October 24, 2022","Thank you for that introduction. I’d like to begin by thanking Ken and SIFMA for inviting me to your Annual Meeting. I’m delighted to be here with all of you.Just over a week ago, I had the opportunity to meet with my counterparts from across the world at the IMF and World Bank in Washington. We spoke about many topics. But one thing was clear: we are at an important moment for the global economy. In the United States, we are focused on transitioning our economy to stable and sustained growth. The U.S. economy retains significant strength. But inflation remains too high, and we are contending with serious global headwinds.So today, I’ll focus first on our Administration’s policies to address the immediate challenges we’ve faced: those that led to a historically strong recovery and subsequently, our concerted actions to address high inflation and energy costs.  Then I’ll turn to our longer-run strategy of investments in the strength of the American economy. As we tackle our immediate challenges, we must not lose sight of what lies on the other side. The United States has long faced structural pressures that have held back our economic potential. But I believe our Administration’s recent legislative accomplishments position the United States to lead the global economy in the decades to come. Starting with our actions to address immediate challenges, at the time of the President’s inauguration, the pandemic was at its peak. The virus had taken over 400,000 lives in our country. And it was claiming an additional 3,000 Americans each day. The economic toll was also staggering. Millions of jobs had been lost. Each week, an average of more than 800,000 new jobless claims were being filed. In many respects, our economy had been brought to a standstill.  And there was no guarantee that we would achieve a rapid recovery. Less than 1 percent of Americans had been fully vaccinated. And the Omicron and Delta waves had yet to hit our shores. We faced unprecedented uncertainty about the course of the economy. In fact, throughout 2020 and 2021, the tail risk was a downturn that could match the Great Depression.To ensure this economic catastrophe would not materialize, the federal government took action: to support households, businesses, and state and local governments through a once-in-a-century public health emergency. We brought the United States back to full employment in record time, in large part due to the American Rescue Plan and our vaccination campaign. As of last month, over 10 million jobs have been created since President Biden took office. Our recovery has also been historically inclusive: 2021 saw the fastest calendar year decline in the number of unemployed Black and Hispanic Americans on record. As we mark this significant progress, it’s important to recognize that we now face serious global headwinds and challenges with elevated inflation. Growth is slowing globally. And energy and food prices have risen, driven partly by Putin’s terrible war in Ukraine and the pandemic’s lingering effects abroad. Climate change continues to devastate communities, exacerbating energy and food shortages in Europe and across the world. Our economy remains resilient, bolstered by President Biden’s economic plan, but we are highly attuned to these risks. Let me be very clear: inflation in the United States remains far too high. Our Administration’s top economic priority is to rein it in. We recognize that the Federal Reserve bears the primary responsibility, but we are taking a broad range of complementary actions to lower costs. They range from de-congesting our ports to bringing down the costs of prescription drugs. We have paid particular attention to energy prices. And we are encouraged by the difference our actions have made. Here at home, our Administration is completing the release of 180 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to boost supply. Treasury analysis indicates that the release has reduced the price of gasoline by 17 to 42 cents per gallon this year. We have also worked with other countries in our effort to stabilize energy prices. The United States has partnered with the G7 to finalize and implement a cap on the price of Russian oil. The goal of this cap is to keep Russian oil flowing onto global markets — at lower prices — while reducing revenue that Putin can use to fund his illegal war. This effort will help stabilize energy markets. It will also provide developing countries with greater leverage to negotiate better prices for Russian oil.Overall, while there are risks, I believe that there is a path toward lowering inflation while preserving the historic economic gains of the past two years. Today, our labor market remains remarkably healthy. Household and business balance sheets do not appear overextended. And banks have strong capital and liquidity positions due to the reforms that we implemented after the Global Financial Crisis.  We are closely monitoring the financial sector, as global developments have led to increased market volatility. To date, the U.S. financial system has not been a source of economic instability. While we continue to watch for emerging risks, our system remains resilient and continues to operate well through uncertainties. Still, we can do more to mitigate potential risks. Our work begins with the Treasury market — the bedrock of our financial system. The Treasury market today is reflecting greater uncertainty about the economic outlook, but trading volumes are robust and investors are able to execute transactions. However, in the past few years, we have seen some episodes of stress in this critical market. These episodes underscore the importance of enhancing its resilience. Treasury is working with financial regulators to advance reforms that improve the Treasury market’s ability to absorb shocks and disruptions, rather than to amplify them. We are also attentive to the possibility that higher market volatility could expose vulnerabilities in nonbank financial intermediation. Since I arrived at Treasury, financial regulators have been working together to better monitor leverage in private funds and develop policies to reduce the first-mover advantage that could lead to investor runs in money market funds and open-end bond funds.   Looking ahead, we are considering the impact of emerging technologies on our financial system. Innovation is one of the hallmarks of a vibrant financial system and economy. But innovation without adequate regulation can result in significant disruptions and harm. As part of that effort, the Treasury Department and its agency counterparts recently completed the federal government’s most comprehensive review of digital assets. These reports represent our most significant effort yet to promote responsible innovation in this area. Our goal is to realize the potential benefits of digital assets while mitigating and minimizing their risks.  For decades, our economy had been suffering from longstanding structural issues. Our economic potential had been weighed down by sluggish productivity growth and declining labor force participation. Inequality had soared, with profound disparities by race and geography. And our economy had been over-exposed to the actions of malicious geopolitical actors like Putin, vulnerabilities in our supply chain, and the growing impacts of climate change. Over the past year, the Biden Administration has advanced an economic plan to tackle these structural issues. Taken together, I believe that the trifecta of legislation that the President has signed into law over the past year — the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act — constitute among the most important economic investments we’ve ever made. Let me discuss three specific ways these laws generate strong, resilient, and inclusive growth.First, our economic plan boosts the productive capacity of our economy. Earlier this year, I laid out an approach to strengthening our potential for economic growth. I called it “modern supply-side economics.” I argued that, with an economy at full employment, we are uniquely suited for a supply-side expansion that raises the ceiling of what our economy can produce. Take infrastructure. Economists have long underscored how basic public infrastructure can increase the productivity of American workers. Studies show that a 10 percent increase in government infrastructure investment grows national output by over 1 percent in the long run. Yet we have neglected our roads and bridges for decades. The result? A staggering one in five miles of highways and major roads in America are in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provides a historic surge in funding for America’s transportation system. These construction projects will have reverberating economic benefits. More efficient movement of goods means fewer costly supply-chain disruptions. Better transportation can connect workers to more training opportunities and higher-productivity jobs. And our efforts go beyond physical infrastructure. We are also closing the digital gap: both by expanding broadband infrastructure and lowering the costs of service for millions of Americans. Second, our economic plan will bolster our resilience to global shocks. The pandemic and Putin’s terrible war in Ukraine have taught us the costs of supply-chain vulnerabilities. We’ve seen empty shelves and volatile prices at the pump — as well as factories idled by the shortage of microchips. Three decades ago, the United States produced over a third of all microchips. Now we’re down to just 12 percent. By one estimate, the recent chip shortage resulted in $240 billion in lost U.S. economic output last year. Our plan is expected to change this dynamic. The CHIPS and Science Act will create a full semiconductor ecosystem here in the United States. We will provide tens of billions of dollars in public capital to strengthen semiconductor R&D, fabrication, and workforce training. We are already seeing a crowding-in effect on private investments. Just this month, two large chip manufacturers announced up to a $120 billion investment in chip production and other advanced technologies here in New York State. Third, our plan spurs inclusive economic growth across the country. For too long, private capital has been highly clustered in a few cities on the coasts. Equality of opportunity is not just a fairness issue. It’s also an economic issue. Our modern supply-side agenda understands that some of the best opportunities for growth come from investing in people and places that have been overlooked. These investments often have a higher relative return on investment, given the law of diminishing returns. And they raise our growth potential by enabling us to tap all of our resources. The Biden economic plan puts this theory into practice. Take the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s the most aggressive action on climate in our nation’s history. This law will help mitigate the worst consequences of climate change, which are borne most disproportionately by the poorest. But it’s also expected to create good-paying jobs across non-coastal areas and regions that have been historically dependent on fossil-fuel extraction. One innovation in our clean energy plan is to provide additional tax incentives for businesses to invest in low-income communities. We’re also incentivizing investment in historic energy communities, like those dependent on coal production. I believe that these concerted economic investments can have cascading effects on the renewal of local communities themselves. In the coming months, we expect to see significant movements of capital into growing industries like semiconductors and clean energy. Many of you here will play a critical role in financing these projects across the country. These are exciting investments: beyond boosting long-term economic growth, they will revitalize communities and bolster the resilience of our country for years to come. Of course, there are serious challenges directly ahead of us. And I know it has been a tough few years for the American people. But our progress thus far shows what our country can do. We have experienced among the strongest recoveries of any major advanced economy. And we’ve made a generational investment to expand our economic capacity. I believe that we can navigate through this current moment as well."
239,,"October 21, 2022","WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Shalanda D. Young today released the final budget results for fiscal year (FY) 2022. During FY 2022, the deficit fell by $1.4 trillion—the largest one-year decrease in the Federal deficit in American history. The 2022 deficit of $1.375 trillion was half of the FY 2021 deficit, $40 billion less than forecasted in the President’s 2023 Budget and $1.8 trillion lower than the deficit the President inherited. As a percentage of GDP, the FY 2022 deficit was 6.8 percentage points lower than in the previous year.[1]From Day One, the Biden-Harris Administration has been working to build an economy that works for everyone. Under the President’s leadership—and thanks in part to the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and a historic vaccination effort—America has more than recovered all of the jobs lost during the pandemic. Our economy has added more than 10 million jobs since the President took office, and the unemployment rate has returned to its pre-pandemic, 50-year low of 3.5 percent. The President’s economic plan has helped usher in a new era of American manufacturing, with nearly 700,000 new manufacturing jobs added since January 2021. And, the historic Inflation Reduction Act will bring down energy, health care, and prescription drug costs, tackle the climate crisis, further reduce the deficit, and make our tax system fairer.“Today’s joint budget statement provides further evidence of our historic economic recovery, driven by our vaccination effort and the American Rescue Plan. It also demonstrates President Biden’s commitment to strengthening our nation’s fiscal health,” Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said. “President Biden’s recently enacted economic plan will build on the economic gains of the past two years. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act will help put the country on a path to sustained economic growth, create new and good-paying jobs across the country, and strengthen American economic resilience for years to come.”“The President’s economic plan is focused on growing our economy from the bottom up and the middle out,” said Shalanda Young, Director of the Office of Management and Budget. “Under his leadership, more Americans are working today than at any point in our country’s history, our economy has added more than 10 million jobs, manufacturing is booming, and we cut last year’s deficit in half. With the historic Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris Administration is going to continue building on this progress and delivering for the American people—cutting everyday costs for families, tackling the climate crisis, and ensuring the biggest corporations pay their fair share.”Year-end data from the September 2022 Monthly Treasury Statement of Receipts and Outlays of the United States Government show that the deficit for FY 2022 was $1.375 trillion—$1.400 trillion less than the prior year’s deficit. As a percentage of GDP, the deficit was 5.5 percent, a decrease of 6.8 percentage points (55 percent) from 12.3 percent in FY 2021.The FY 2022 deficit was $40 billion less than the estimate of $1.415 trillion in the 2023 Budget published in May, and $344 billion higher than the estimate of $1.032 trillion in the Mid-Session Review (MSR), a supplemental update to the Budget published in August.Governmental receipts totaled $4.896 trillion in FY 2022 and exceeded Budget projections but were less than MSR projections. As a share of GDP, receipts were 19.6 percent. Relative to FY 2021, receipts increased by $850 billion, an increase of 21 percent. The increase in receipts for FY 2022 is primarily attributable to higher individual and corporation income tax collections and social insurance and retirement receipts, along with increases in most other sources of receipts.Outlays were $6.272 trillion in FY 2022, $420 billion higher than projected in the Budget and $299 billion higher than projected in the MSR. Compared with FY 2021, outlays decreased $550 billion, or 8.1 percent. This decrease in part reflects reductions in COVID-related spending, including unemployment insurance and Small Business Administration programs. Outlays for some other categories of spending increased, including student loans, Medicare, and net interest.Total Federal borrowing from the public increased by $2.0 trillion during FY 2022 to $24.3 trillion. The increase in borrowing included $1.4 trillion in borrowing to finance the deficit as well as $0.6 trillion in net borrowing related to other transactions such as changes in cash balances and net disbursements for Federal credit programs. As a percentage of GDP, borrowing from the public fell from 98.4 percent of GDP at the end of FY 2021 to 97.0 percent of GDP at the end of FY 2022.To coincide with the release of the Federal Government’s year-end financial data, Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service) is releasing a new version of Your Guide to America’s Finances (Your Guide). The Fiscal Service created Your Guide in 2019 to make Federal financial information transparent and accessible to all Americans. The latest version offers easy-to-understand explainer pages and makes content more accessible on mobile devices. The data in Your Guide are automatically updated throughout the year as new data become available, ensuring that the public has access to the latest financial information as quickly as possible.Total receipts for FY 2022 were $4,896.1 billion, $44.6 billion lower than the MSR estimate of $4,940.7 billion. This net decrease in receipts was the net effect of lower-than-estimated collections of individual income taxes, deposits of earnings by the Federal Reserve, other miscellaneous receipts, and customs duties, partially offset by higher-than-estimated collections of corporation income taxes, social insurance and retirement receipts, estate and gift taxes, and excise taxes. Table 2 displays actual receipts and estimates from the MSR by source.Total outlays were $6,271.5 billion for FY 2022, $299.3 billion higher than the MSR estimate. Table 3 displays actual outlays by agency and major program as well as estimates from the Budget and the MSR. The largest changes in outlays from the MSR were in the following areas:Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) outlays in FY 2022 were approximately $16.9 billion below MSR estimates. This is due to a combination of unexpected delays in the issuance of Pandemic EBT benefits in some states; a faster-than-anticipated decline in the use of Emergency Allotment payments provided during the COVID-19 pandemic; and lower-than-anticipated program participation.Outlays in the Child Nutrition Programs were about $5.3 billion higher than MSR estimates. About half of this difference was due to outlays from a transfer of funds for Local Food Procurement and Management and funding provided in the Keep Kids Fed Act. In addition, the cost of the waivers allowing for universal free school meals in school year 2022-2023 was greater than anticipated.Actual outlays for the Office of the Secretary in FY 2022 were $3.1 billion higher than the estimate in MSR. This is primarily due to faster-than-anticipated implementation of the Emergency Relief Program (ERP), which provided indemnity payments to farmers impacted by natural disasters. The agency had only assumed in $1 billion in outlays in MSR for ERP.Department of Defense — Outlays for the Department of Defense were $726.6 billion, $7.1 billion higher than the MSR estimate. This difference is mostly due to higher-than expected outlays for such as operational and training costs including fuel ($1.7 billion), Air Force and Defense-wide research, development, test, and evaluation activities ($2.8 billion), and Air Force and Army personnel ($2.5 billion).Department of Education — Outlays for the Department of Education were $639.4 billion, $408.0 billion higher than the MSR estimate. Outlays in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program and the Family Federal Education Loan Program were $429.2 billion higher than the MSR estimate due primarily to upward modifications for extensions of the pause of student loan payments, interest, and collections first authorized by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, waivers related to income-driven repayment forgiveness and Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and broad-based student loan forgiveness authorized by the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students (HEROES) Act of 2003. Outlays in the Elementary and Secondary Education account were $20.1 billion lower than the MSR estimate primarily due to challenges in the State and local administration of ARP and other COVID-19 supplemental appropriations, including ongoing staffing shortages in school districts and supply chain constraints that have pushed out dates for completing facility upgrades.Department of Health and Human Services — Outlays for the Department of Health and Human Services were $1.643 trillion, $17.7 billion lower than the MSR estimate. Gross outlays for Medicare’s Hospital Insurance (HI) and Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust funds were $8.0 billion and $3.5 billion higher than projected due to the timing of payments to Medicare Advantage plans. There were more receipts than expected for the fiscal year, largely due to refunds, which totaled $50.0 billion for HI and $26.9 billion for SMI in 2022. The increase in refunds is partially from the repayment of Medicare accelerated and advance payments to providers and suppliers.The actual outlays for other health programs were $14.3 billion lower than projected in MSR, primarily due to the absence of an appropriation for Cost-Sharing Reductions. Outlays for the Indian Health Services were $3.8 billion lower than MSR due to a slowdown in outlays in the fourth quarter. Outlays for Medicaid were $5.8 billion above the MSR estimate, primarily driven by higher-than-anticipated enrollment.Department of Homeland Security — Outlays for the Department of Homeland Security were $80.9 billion, $10.2 billion lower than the MSR estimate. Approximately $7 billion of the difference is driven by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), of which over $5 billion is due to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund. This is due to slower-than-anticipated grant draw-downs from states, including for COVID-19 response spending. In general, states have slowed down reimbursement requests and are likely spending down other Federal resources.Department of Labor — Outlays for the Department of Labor were $51.7 billion, $51.6 billion lower than the MSR estimate. The difference is predominately due to lower-than-expected outlays from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation’s (PBGC) Special Financial Assistance Program (SFA). PBGC outlays were $47.3 billion lower than expected as a result of a number of multi-employer pension plans withdrawing or delaying their application for SFA until after the release of the SFA final rule released on July 6, 2022, which is used to calculate the amount of Special Financial Assistance that would be awarded to pension plans. In addition, outlays for the Employment and Training Administration were $4.6 billion lower than expected as a result of recoveries of overpayments of pandemic Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits, particularly from the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) and Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) programs. Recoveries in these programs were higher than initially projected.Department of State — Outlays for the Department of State were $33.2 billion, $3.4 billion lower than the MSR estimate. Outlays were lower than expected for Department of State programs associated with the administration of foreign affairs, mostly due to lower-than-anticipated spending for diplomatic and consular operations, as well as lower outlays than estimated for humanitarian assistance and international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance programs.Department of Transportation — Outlays for the Department of Transportation were $113.7 billion, $9.2 billion lower than the MSR estimate. More than half of this difference was due to slower-than-expected spending of Federal Transit Administration (FTA) COVID supplemental funding for a variety of reasons, including supply chain disruptions and labor force shortages that impacted local transit agencies’ ability to spend Federal funds.  The other major reason for the difference was that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Amtrak agreed to a new payment method for Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act supplemental funds, under which FRA will outlay quarterly based on Amtrak’s estimated funding needs for the upcoming period.Interest on the public debt, which is paid to the public and to trust funds and other Government accounts, was $36.6 billion higher than the MSR estimate. The difference was due primarily to higher-than-projected interest paid on inflation-protected securities held both by the public and by Government accounts.Net outlays for intragovernmental interest transactions with non-budgetary credit financing accounts were $8.2 billion higher than projected, including $6.1 billion in lower-than-projected receipts of interest from credit financing accounts and $2.0 billion higher-than-anticipated interest paid to credit financing accounts. (Interest received from credit financing accounts is reported in Treasury’s aggregate offsetting receipts.)Non-IRS pandemic response programs enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and the ARP accounted for $6.4 billion in lower-than-projected outlays. This difference was mostly attributable to $3.7 billion less-than-forecasted outlays by the Emergency Rental Assistance program, because of slower-than-expected spending by recipients, which delayed subsequent disbursements. This difference also reflected $1.6 billion in lower-than-estimated outlays by the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI), $0.7 billion lower outlays by the ARP state and local programs, and $0.4 billion lower outlays by the Homeowner Assistance Fund due to slower-than-expected recipient submissions and ongoing award and compliance reviews.Outlays for individual and corporate refundable credits created in the CARES Act, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, and the ARP, along with coronavirus payments (e.g., Economic Impact Payments), were $15.8 billion lower than estimated at MSR due to lower-than-expected take-up and other factors. Other refundable credits were $1.3 billion lower than estimated. This was partly offset by outlays for Refundable Premium Tax Credits, which were $7.3 billion higher than estimated at MSR due to increased enrollment in the individual health insurance market.Net outlays for other Treasury activities were $4.3 billion lower than MSR estimates, reflecting (among other factors) lower-than-projected net outlays for IRS administrative expenses, Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) housing programs and Treasury Forfeiture Fund activities.The difference was driven mostly by differences in Benefits programs, which were $4.6 billion lower than the MSR estimate, and Departmental Administration programs, which were $4.0 billion lower than the MSR estimate. Benefits programs were lower than expected in part due to fewer beneficiaries accessing benefits than estimated. Departmental Administration programs were lower than expected in part due to delays in Electronic Health Record Modernization deployment. These differences were partially offset by outlays in the Veterans Health Administration that were higher than estimated at MSR.Undistributed Offsetting Receipts — Undistributed Offsetting Receipts were -$418.4 billion, $10.3 billion higher net collections than the MSR estimate.Interest received by trust funds was $9.9 billion lower than the MSR estimate (higher interest collections). The difference was due largely to Military Retirement Fund interest earnings on inflation-protected securities. Total Military Retirement Fund interest earnings were $9.4 billion higher than the MSR estimate. This intragovernmental interest is paid out of the Department of the Treasury account for interest on the public debt and has no net impact on total Federal Government outlays."

242,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

244,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
245,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

246,,"October 13, 2022","The United States remains resolute in its condemnation of Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine, which violates international norms and the core tenets of the United Nations Charter. We urge Russia to immediately end this needless war. We stand with the Ukrainian people and their government against Russia’s aggression and fraudulent attempts to annex parts of Ukraine. We continue to provide critical military and economic support to Ukraine in cooperation with bilateral and multilateral partners. This economic support includes debt service suspension from Ukraine’s Group of Creditors through 2023, alongside financing from international financial institutions (IFIs) and direct bilateral aid. While the Ukrainian people pay the highest price, Russia’s actions also place immense pressure on a global economy still recovering from the scarring effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and on people well beyond Europe’s shores. The IMF and World Bank play unique roles in helping countries around the world respond to these shocks while collaborating to provide unprecedented financing.The global economy was already dealing with supply and demand imbalances and elevated inflation prior to this war. The spillovers from Russia’s war against Ukraine have increased food, fertilizer, and energy prices; further elevating inflation and increasing food insecurity in many countries. A price cap on Russian oil exports will help support stable energy prices and a steady flow of oil to energy markets in the short term.The challenges facing us are difficult and diverse. For many of us inflation is the key challenge, while some face both rising inflation and weakening growth, and others are buffeted by tighter financing conditions and rising debt. Our appropriately different policies at this time are also contributing to currency movements that can cause spillovers and struggles in other countries. While our policies may differ, we must all aim at our shared goal of strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.It is critical that IFIs provide tailored policy advice and targeted financing and technical support, alongside capacity development, to support low-income countries facing spillovers from Russia’s war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other shocks. To this end, I welcome continued efforts to further finance the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The United States recently contributed $70 million to the PRGT’s subsidy reserve account, and the Biden Administration continues to work with our Congress to lend up to $21 billion to the PRGT and the Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST). I strongly support the IMF’s work to operationalize the RST by the end of this year, including the health window, and urge continued collaboration with the World Bank on the careful design of its conditions.We are seeing a sharp rise in risks of debt distress among developing and emerging market economies. I urge the IMF and World Bank to strengthen their collaboration on debt-related efforts, including promoting transparency and best practices around complex types of borrowing such as collateralized debt. I am concerned by the slow progress in resolving the first cases under the Common Framework. All creditors need to commit to improving the process, starting by concluding debt treatments for Chad and Zambia by the end of this year. We should also consider expanding the Common Framework to include middle-income countries. The long established and respected principle of preferred creditor status is critical to the IFIs’ strong and steady support for low-income countries, especially during crises. All shareholders must respect this principle. I also encourage the World Bank to continue making progress on the implementation of the Sustainable Development Financing Policy to incentivize International Development Association-eligible countries to move toward transparent and sustainable financing.As other challenges push health issues from the forefront, we should not forget that public health crises will remain an ongoing threat. In this regard, I urge the World Bank Group (WBG) to continue their efforts, alongside the private sector, to scale up multilateral support for the production, acquisition, and delivery of vaccines in Africa. I also welcome the launch of the Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness, and Response Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) at the World Bank, with the partnership of the World Health Organization and broad support of the G20. The United States looks forward to the FIF’s first call for proposals to finance investments in developing countries that strengthen prevention, preparedness, and response capabilities for COVID-19 and future pandemics. The establishment of the FIF is a good example of the intensive collaboration between finance and health authorities that the G20 initiated through the Joint Finance-Health Task Force.We must also work together to address other global challenges. We need collective action to address food insecurity by increasing the supply of food worldwide and committing to its free movement across the globe. I welcome the steps the IFIs have taken to alleviate the suffering of the poorest and most vulnerable, including the IMF Executive Board’s recent approval of a new emergency food shock window, which will be available immediately to help countries address food security challenges. I also welcome the World Bank's $30 billion program to address immediate needs, as well as longer-term challenges, including by helping countries invest in sustainable agricultural and water conservation practices. To enhance resilience to future shocks, we need to work now to help communities build long-term resilience in the face of climate change.Climate change is a shared, existential challenge. Our individual actions have important spillovers around the world. The Inflation Reduction Act places the United States on track to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by the end of the decade. I recognize that every country’s transition pathway will vary, and I urge others to implement climate policies to accelerate a just energy transition, while increasing energy access. The United States is also partnering with a few emerging market countries committed to bringing significant levels of public and private finance to shift away from greenhouse gas-intensive energy sources toward renewables. It is important that the World Bank lead in the global energy transition by providing sound analysis to inform countries of climate-related macroeconomic risks and support countries as they look to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.To this end, the WBG should more effectively deploy its convening and financing role to advance climate goals and integrate adaptation and resilience across all its lines of effort, while also making progress to align its operations to the Paris Agreement. I welcome the progress the WBG has made with its Country Climate and Development Reports, which will help countries define and move their climate agendas forward, and applaud exceeding the 35% climate finance target. To meaningfully address the climate crisis, the private sector must play a key role in providing bold investments in high-quality sustainable infrastructure that supports an economic shift aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement. I expect the WBG to lead in the design and delivery of solutions to mobilize private capital focused on high-quality sustainable infrastructure.Many of the biggest challenges we face cross boundaries and disproportionately affect the poorest and most vulnerable populations. No one country can successfully tackle challenges like climate change, pandemics, or fragility and conflict in isolation, yet it is necessary to address them to improve the outlook and catalyze sustainable development in all development countries. However, our existing multilateral development finance architecture was not designed to address these types of cross-border challenges. It was designed for projects where the benefits chiefly accrued to the country that was borrowing for the project. Today, we must be able to invest in projects where the benefits are diffuse. When countries take action on these global challenges, the benefits spill over to the entire world. The global community has a responsibility to help fund action where the benefits are global. It cannot rely only on developing countries to borrow at usual rates to fund these activities.For this reason, I call on the WBG to explore areas of reform to its vision, incentives, operational approach, and financial model to better respond to global challenges, while retaining its focus on the twin goals of poverty reduction and shared prosperity. I ask WBG Management to identify gaps in the WBG’s current institutional and operational framework, and within the context of the international development finance architecture, deliver a roadmap by year-end for consideration by the World Bank Executive Board. The roadmap should include proposals to strengthen the WBG’s role and capacity to address global challenges, including by mobilizing private capital and domestic resources; incentivize country demand and the effective use of WBG financing for global challenges; contribute to strengthening coordination and collaboration across the broader international financial architecture; and design pertinent financial reforms to make the most efficient use of the WBG’s balance sheet and generate new resources. To this end, I strongly encourage WBG Management to draw from the G20 Independent Review of MDB Capital Adequacy Frameworks which will also help safeguard the WBG’s long-term financial sustainability, robust credit ratings, and preferred creditor status.Strong governance and accountability serve as the foundation of the World Bank and IMF. These institutions must continue to espouse the principles and standards they ask of their members. I encourage World Bank Management to continue its efforts to instill trust in its workforce and strengthen the Bank’s reputation as a respectful, well-governed, inclusive, and effective workplace. I welcome the IMF’s implementation of recommendations from its review of institutional safeguards, and look forward to the review of the IMF’s framework for addressing country governance issues in its surveillance and lending programs. Promoting diversity at the IMF and World Bank is critical to these institutions’ effectiveness and sustainability. I welcome the recent approval of the Fund’s gender strategy to bolster diversity and inclusion, and call on Governors to take steps to promote gender diversity at the IMF and World Bank Executive Boards.Finally, in the face of the overlapping challenges in front of us, I want to thank the staff at the IFIs, as well as my staff, for their tireless public service to push forward an agenda which will provide much needed support to those suffering globally and place the global economy on surer footing. Without their efforts, none of this would be possible."
247,,"October 12, 2022","Thank you for inviting me to meet with the Bretton Woods Committee. I greatly appreciate the Committee’s work in fostering effective global cooperation at this uncertain time in our world economy.Let me start by saying that we are in the middle of a productive week at the Annual Meetings. We are making progress on a wide range of difficult issues, from food security to poverty alleviation. We are also positioning the multilateral development banks to better tackle a growing number of global challenges. These include climate change, pandemics, and fragility and conflict.But I want to focus my brief remarks today on the immediate macroeconomic challenges facing the global economy. Specifically, I will focus on the approach that the major economies are taking to lead the world through this moment.We recognize the difficult and diverse challenges that face the global economy today. Over the past two years, we have dealt with the twin disruptions of the pandemic and Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine. There have been shortages in key goods and volatility in the prices of food, fuel, and fertilizer. Many of us face inflation that is too high. Some face both high inflation and weakening growth. Others are facing acute stress on their energy supplies. And on net, the IMF is projecting slow growth both this year and the next.But my message to you today is simple: this week, the global community is coming together to tackle the urgent challenges that we face. It is our collective priority to put the global economy on surer footing.Our path forward begins with the jobs we have to do at home. I have discussed with my counterparts our assessments on the current global situation. And we have spoken about the decisive actions that each of us are taking to tackle our individual challenges. In the United States, our top economic priority is to bring down inflation while maintaining a strong labor market. Our economy remains resilient in the face of global economic headwinds, bolstered by President Biden’s economic plan, but we are highly attuned to the risks on the horizon. Many other major economies are facing high inflation as well. They must also continue implementing policies to rein that in.We will also be attentive to the global repercussions of our policies. Macroeconomic tightening in advanced economies can have international spillovers. This week provides us with an opportunity to strengthen our communication and coordination. The IMF and other international financial institutions play a critical role in making sure that our economic policies remain globally consistent. We know that developing countries, in particular, are often most acutely affected by shocks and spillovers.I believe that we must be prepared to help countries that fall into distress. The IMF and multilateral development banks have well-developed tools to help countries calibrate their policies and address those in need. All major bilateral creditors should also meaningfully participate in debt relief to help countries regain their footing. Throughout this week, I have been speaking with leaders from around the world about the way global macroeconomic forces are affecting their countries.We must also continue to advance global solutions to our shared global challenges. Among our top priorities is to work with our partners to mitigate the fallout of Russia’s war in Ukraine on energy and food security. The United States and its partners have committed to finalize and implement a cap on the price of Russian oil. And we’ve coordinated with other countries through the International Energy Agency for the release of oil from emergency reserves. As part of an overall global effort to tackle food insecurity, the United States is committing around $10 billion this year to deliver food to those who are facing starvation and to build longer-term resilience. And we’ve worked closely with the international financial institutions and asked them to issue and implement an Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity.Longer term, the Biden Administration is also committed to working with our partners to build greater resilience, in America and globally, to the types of shocks we’ve seen. That goal has been at the core of President Biden’s economic plan. Let me give you two examples.First, to strengthen long-term energy security, the United States has enacted the Inflation Reduction Act. It’s the most significant domestic action on climate in our history. As we make progress at home, we are also pressing the World Bank and other development banks to raise their climate ambitions while pursuing their existing development priorities. The world’s transition to a clean energy future is critical to saving our planet. And it’s critical to reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and the autocratic regimes that often control them.Second, we are also modernizing our trade relationships and supply chains to make them more resilient to global shocks. “Friendshoring” is our approach to advancing trade that is free and fair – and secure. Global trade brings efficiencies. It helps drive down prices and supports American workers and consumers. At the same time, we have learned from hard experience that supply chain vulnerabilities can impose heavy costs. We know the cost of Russia’s weaponization of trade as a tool of geopolitical coercion, and we must mitigate similar vulnerabilities to countries like China.So, we believe it’s important to deepen integration with the large number of countries that we can count on. That includes many emerging markets and developing countries. We also need to build in redundancies in our supply chain to mitigate concentration risks. We are advancing this agenda through forums like the U.S.-E.U. Trade and Technology Council and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.All in all, the global economy faces significant headwinds. But this is no time to retreat. These moments require leadership. The United States and our partners are determined to move forward decisively and collectively. And together, we will shape a better tomorrow."
248,,"October 12, 2022","I thank President Zelensky and Prime Minister Shmyhal for addressing this group.  The American people stand resolutely with Ukraine in the face of Russia's brutal and illegal war, especially after Monday’s barbaric strikes on non-military targets throughout Ukraine.In our meeting yesterday, I offered my condolences to Minister Marchenko for the lives lost.  Once again, the world has seen the true nature of Putin’s war.In response to Russia’s war of choice, our historic sanctions coalition is restricting Russia’s access to the technology and equipment it needs to supply its military.  And with our price cap on Russian oil, we are targeting Russia’s key source of revenue while stabilizing global energy markets.The Ukrainian military has mounted a heroic defense against Russia’s brutal attacks on the battlefield.  Ukraine’s economic and finance officials have also done their part by continuing to provide critical services to the people of Ukraine and keeping Ukraine’s government operational under extraordinary circumstances.And now, donors need to keep stepping up.  The United States recently reaffirmed our commitment to Ukraine through Congressional approval of another $4.5 billion in grant assistance, which we will begin to disburse in the coming weeks.This is in addition to the $8.5 billion in grants already disbursed, making the United States the largest provider of economic assistance to Ukraine.  To that end, I’d like to thank the World Bank for facilitating these disbursements.We also appreciate the World Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s support for Ukraine, which have included helping donors like us channel resources to Ukraine. In addition, we welcome the IMF’s disbursement of $1.3 billion in new emergency financing and urge the IMF to use the envisioned monitoring program to lay the groundwork to establish a full-fledged program for Ukraine early next year.As Russia’s shameful actions continue, we must continue our joint efforts and begin planning for Ukraine’s needs in 2023.  To this point, we welcome the World Bank’s Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment and the upcoming IMF’s validation of Ukraine’s budget to help anchor donor coordination.Meeting Ukraine’s needs will require a unified and coordinated effort, but together, the G7, the international financial institutions, and all of Ukraine’s partners can help Ukraine win this war and rebuild to become the prosperous and secure democracy that the Ukrainian people have fought so hard for. "
249,,"October 11, 2022","Finance Minister Sitharaman, I am pleased to welcome you back to the Treasury Department today.  The U.S.-India relationship is critical to addressing the world’s most important global economic challenges. I am glad to announce today that in November ahead of the G20 meetings, I will take my first trip to India as Treasury Secretary, to attend the U.S-India Economic and Financial Partnership, our ninth Partnership meeting. This partnership not only is vital to our core economic interests. It also demonstrates to our citizens and the world that democracies deliver.  It illustrates the close bonds between our two countries, from the Quad partnership, to our strong bilateral economic relationship, and the cultural ties from the Indian diaspora in the U.S. The United States and India are both extremely important to the world economy, and we must continue to work together on the economic development and cooperation that has made our partnership so strong.   We also face shared headwinds stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's unjust war against Ukraine.  Those global shocks have raised energy and food prices in both of our countries, and they've underscored the importance of the efforts both of our countries are undertaking to make our economies more resilient.  Today, I look forward to discussing our efforts to strengthen our supply chains and invest in clean sources of energy – in addition to steps that America is taking to keep global oil markets well-supplied in the near term.  That is particularly important given how high energy costs have affected consumers in both of our countries – and in emerging markets globally. India’s assumption of the G20 presidency in December is also an opportunity for more concerted global cooperation. I look forward to discussing India’s priorities for their host year and how the United States can best support you as you take on this important role.   The United States is also pleased that India is joining the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.  Through the Framework, the United States and its partners will deepen our economic bonds, strengthen our supply chains to avoid costly disruptions, and help develop the guiding standards and rules for technological innovation in the years and decades to come.  "
250,,"October 11, 2022","Thank you, Minister Marchenko  for coming to DC while Ukraine continues to defend its sovereignty against Russia’s brutal war of aggression—including Putin’s horrific missile attacks yesterday that injured and took the lives of innocent civilians.I want to offer our deepest condolences to the people of Ukraine, and especially those whose loved ones were senselessly killed yesterday. Once again, the world has seen the true nature of Russia’s barbaric and illegal war. The United States continues to stand resolutely with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. We will continue to support you as you rebuild the prosperous and free Ukraine that your country has fought so hard to secure.Two weeks ago, Congress passed $4.5 billion in direct budget support for Ukraine, which I’m pleased to announce the United States will begin to disburse to the Ukrainian government in the coming weeks. We are committed to getting this funding to you as soon as possible because we know how important it is in supporting your brave resistance to Russia’s illegal invasion.This brings the United States’ total economic assistance to Ukraine to $13 billion, all in grants. In addition, we have joined the Group of Creditors to suspend Ukraine’s bilateral debt service payments this year and next year. But let me be clear: international support for Ukraine is a collective effort. We are calling on our partners and allies to join us by swiftly disbursing their existing commitments to Ukraine and by stepping up in doing more—both to help Ukraine continue its essential government services and to help Ukraine begin to build and recover.I look forward to our conversation today to better understand the outlook for Ukraine’s economy, your financing needs for next year, and how we can begin to help Ukraine rebuild from the destruction inflicted by Russia.We'll also discuss ways that the U.S. and our global coalition can continue to impose sanctions on Russia, its public finances, and its military industry. Importantly, the focus of our sanctions and export controls on Russia's military industrial complex have disrupted Russia’s operations, shuttered factories, depleted arsenals, and forced Putin to rely increasingly on arms suppliers of last resort, like North Korea and Iran.Together with the G7, the United States will build on that work with our price cap on Russian oil, which will cut into Putin's key source of revenue even as we mitigate future price spikes caused by Putin's war."
251,,"October 6, 2022","Thank you for the introduction, Masood.  It’s great to be here at the Center for Global Development. I’m appreciative of your critical work to reduce poverty and improve lives around the world, including through your work on the multilateral development banks.Today, I will focus my remarks on our vision for development: the promise and challenges in developing countries, and how we can evolve the development finance system to better address the needs of the 21st century.  But first, I will speak about the global context: both our short-term and longer-term challenges.As we meet today, in the wake of two large, back-to-back shocks, the global economy faces significant uncertainty.  The pandemic caused a staggering loss of life and unprecedented fluctuations in economic activity and global commerce.And earlier this year, Vladimir Putin launched a brutal war against Ukraine.  The human toll has been devastating.  Putin’s fraudulent attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory is the latest example of his blatant contempt for the United Nations Charter and peaceful nations everywhere.  The war’s economic impacts are reverberating far beyond the borders of Ukraine and Europe, causing volatile energy, food, and fertilizer prices, which impose substantial harm on many countries across the globe.At the beginning of the Global Financial Crisis, the world’s major economies faced a similar suite of problems and responded with a similar suite of remedies.  The same was true at the start of the pandemic.  In contrast, the last year has seen divergent economic pressures.  Many advanced economies, but not all, face inflation that is too high.  Some major economies face more acute stress due to uncertain energy supplies than others.  These different challenges require different policy approaches.  For major economies facing high inflation, the immediate task is to return to an environment of stable prices.  Central banks bear the prime responsibility.  But it is important to recognize that macroeconomic tightening in advanced countries can have international spillovers.  Differences in countries’ circumstances and in their respective policies are bound to result in some currency realignments.  The G7 has committed to market-determined exchange rates.  But we are attentive to the potential consequences of exchange rate movements. Emerging markets and developing countries are often most acutely affected both by global shocks and by spillovers from the policies of advanced countries.  Swings in capital flows and financial pressures resulting from higher interest rates can add additional stress on top of significant and strained debt vulnerabilities.  Some countries face acute food insecurity, exacerbated by climate change.  Many are struggling with energy supply.  Others, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, suffer from insufficient deployment of vaccines and boosters.  Many developing countries – with the most limited resources and policy space, and high debt burdens – are facing all these challenges simultaneously.During next week’s IMF and World Bank Annual Meetings, I will work with a broad group of partners to advance our response to the current macroeconomic challenges.  Policymakers in the major economies must continue implementing policies to rein in high inflation while remaining attentive to global repercussions.  Clear and open communications, coupled with cooperation among the major economies to address spillovers, remain essential. From energy to food security, the United States and our partners have coordinated to stem the fallout from Russia’s war against Ukraine felt by people around the world.  Since spring, the United States has released 160 million barrels of crude oil to shore up supply, and our coalition has committed to finalize and implement a cap on the price of Russian oil.  This cap aims to keep Russian oil flowing onto global markets at lower prices – particularly benefitting low- and middle-income countries – while also cutting into the revenue Putin is using to fund his illegal war.  The United States has also pledged almost $10 billion to tackle the growing food security crisis.  The international financial institutions are redoubling their efforts by implementing a food security action plan announced in May.  These efforts must continue.We must also be prepared to help countries that fall into debt or other crises.  Broadly speaking, we have well-developed tools to support countries in need.  For example, the IMF and the multilateral development banks have resources to support and advise countries as they calibrate their macroeconomic policies. Some countries will need considerable debt relief.  Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, more than half of all low-income countries were at high risk of or already in debt distress.  It will be crucial for all the world’s major bilateral creditors to meaningfully participate in debt relief so that lower- and middle-income countries can regain their footing after these years of extreme stress.  This is particularly true for China.  To date, China has delayed providing debt treatments to borrowers in debt distress or has provided treatments that fall short of restoring the borrower’s debt sustainability.  We need to redouble our efforts to resolve ongoing cases – like Zambia and Sri Lanka – and be prepared to work together on future cases.The immediate issues I’ve highlighted call for urgent action.  At the same time, we must not lose sight of big picture, longer-run challenges, particularly in developing countries.  The remainder of my remarks will focus on these challenges: what they mean for developing countries and how to address them.The last several decades have seen substantial alleviation of world poverty.  But recent crises are eroding those gains.  At least 75 million additional people are facing extreme poverty this year.  Without urgent and concerted action, the world is unlikely to meet the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.Longstanding problems are the cause of persistent poverty and inequality.  Those problems include lack of access to education and healthcare and basic infrastructure like clean water, electricity, roads, and broadband.  Ineffective, nontransparent institutions foster corruption and political oppression.  They also limit the rights of women and minorities.  And developing countries – along with the rest of the world – are experiencing increasing incidents of extreme weather, driven by climate change, with agriculture especially vulnerable.  Addressing these contributors to poverty has always been central to development policy.  But this agenda is particularly important in unlocking key trends that are shaping the future of the developing world.  Let me touch on two examples.      The first is demographics.  Most of the world’s net population growth over the next century will be in Sub-Saharan Africa and certain regions of Asia.  In Africa, an estimated 1.7 million individuals are now entering the job market each month.  These future generations will expand the labor force and could drive new innovations and productivity gains.  But capitalizing on the promise of a growing population necessitates investments today in both human capital and sustainable infrastructure.   The second trend pertains to technology and digitalization.  Greater connectivity can bring significant efficiencies.  It can also spur innovation and democratize access to finance, education, and health.  But realization of these benefits requires investment in digital infrastructure.  At the same time, countries need to strengthen their regulatory frameworks and enforcement against illicit activity and threats to cybersecurity and privacy.  The growth of the digital economy must expand opportunity; it must not exacerbate inequality.   In the past, most anti-poverty strategies have been country focused.  But today, some of the most powerful threats to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable require a different approach.  Why so?  Because the challenges are global rather than “country specific.” A prime example of such a challenge is climate change.  Indeed, it is an existential threat to our planet.  No country can tackle it alone.  Success requires all countries to work together to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Understanding the economic and human risks of climate change to Americans and to the world, the United States has just enacted our most aggressive domestic action on climate yet.  We are committed to a net-zero economy by 2050. We must also help developing countries transition their economies away from carbon-intensive energy sources and expand access to clean energy. To advance this objective, Treasury is announcing a new nearly $1 billion contribution to the Clean Technology Fund and the Biden Administration remains committed to boosting international climate financing to over $11 billion by 2024.In addition to abating emissions, countries must also build greater resilience to climate change’s impacts.  Recently, devastating floods in Pakistan dislocated more than 33 million people and destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland. Global climate change has stark consequences at every level – local, national, and regional.  The world must mitigate climate change and the resultant consequences of forced migration, regional conflicts, and supply disruptions.  Pandemics are another key global challenge.  As the COVID pandemic has demonstrated, pathogens do not respect borders. If unchecked, pandemics can bring the global economy to a standstill.  Uneven access to vaccines and medicines – along with underinvestment in public awareness and public health infrastructure – can cause outbreaks of new variants that disrupt the entire world. We must build on the work we have already done, which includes the new Financial Intermediary Fund for pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response housed at the World Bank.  And we must accelerate our work to help countries build robust public health infrastructure.And of course, local fragility, conflicts, and violence can spill over to neighboring regions. As of June, the U.N. estimates that there are more than 100 million people worldwide displaced by conflict, violence, and fear of persecution.  That is almost 60 million more than just a decade ago. Displacement of people and broken supply chains can ripple through regions and the world. To contend with these effects, governments will have to increase their budgets for security, refugees, or disaster recovery.  That will likely be at the expense of investments such as education and health. Some people have said that limited resources and capacity constraints pose a tension between progress on development and addressing these global challenges.  But that is a false choice. We must do both: especially since these priorities are mutually reinforcing. Unmitigated global challenges can be destructive to our development aspirations by putting at risk investment, financial stability, and human health and welfare. Conversely, lack of development can magnify global challenges and increase vulnerabilities, with negative spillovers onto the rest of the world.We need to come together to develop new strategies, policies, and approaches to mobilize financing more effectively: across domestic resources, the official sector, and the private sector.  There is a huge pool of global savings.  But the flow to developing countries is limited.  Why?  The obstacles include information asymmetry, a scarcity of bankable projects, and political and regulatory uncertainty. There is also a shortage of tools to diversify risks beyond individual projects with uncertain returns.  Now there is broader macroeconomic uncertainty.  And private investors remain risk averse.These impediments make it crucial for us to examine our strategies for bringing together different sources of financing, for deepening capital markets, and for expanding lending in local currencies. The private sector has a key role to play, especially now, with countries struggling to recover from COVID and with constrained fiscal space.  Investors must recognize the tremendous promise and need for investments in developing countries, with their huge potential upside in both financial and human development terms. On their own, the multilateral development banks cannot provide financing on the scale that is needed.  But they are a critical part of the solution.  In concert with developing countries, the multilateral development banks have worked effectively for more than 75 years in designing holistic economy-wide development strategies.  They have provided direct financing for roads, basic education and health, water and sanitation, and energy.  They have done so on financial terms that countries cannot access from the market.Beyond direct financing, the multilateral development banks have served as pioneers in development finance.  Development banks step in to fund activities that may never be profitable for private investors.  They provide essential funding for countries recovering from disasters and conflict – as, for example, in Bosnia and Liberia, and as we expect them to do in Ukraine.  They help scale development solutions that work.  And they help chart the course for private investors by diffusing risk and providing policy advice to strengthen countries’ institutional frameworks for investment.  All in all, these banks have a broad set of tools to address many of the challenges I have outlined. But the multilateral development banks need to evolve as well.  They have a strong record of financing national projects like infrastructure, where the costs and the benefits both largely accrue to the same country.  But to address the complex global challenges I described, we also need to invest in programs where the costs and benefits are more diffuse.  We do not yet have a sufficiently robust toolkit to address, with scale and urgency, our global and cross-border challenges. The shareholders of these banks must ask them to devise new approaches to address global challenges without diminution of their traditional focus on poverty reduction and other Sustainable Development Goals.  I strongly believe that tackling these global challenges will bolster the banks’ existing work on poverty alleviation.  After all, climate change, threats to global health, and fragility have a disproportionate impact on the poor.It is appropriate to consider greater use of concessional resources, including grants, to fund investments where the benefits are shared more broadly by the world.  For example, I see a case for concessional financing to help middle-income countries transition away from coal in the context of accelerating the clean energy transition.  If the global community benefits from investments in climate, then the global community should help bear the cost.The development banks should also use their research and analytical capacity to provide improved diagnostics related to global challenges.  They can use policy advice and conditionality to encourage countries, especially those with access to other financing, to direct funding towards investments with broader benefits.In addition to the traditional country-based lending model, it is time to consider expanded options.  The development banks may need to support both global and regional entities. Tackling global challenges requires global coordination and funding pools that go beyond national governments.  During the pandemic, for example, global organizations like COVAX have been vital to expediting the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines to a broad range of developing countries. The development banks should also consider targeting additional resources toward sub-sovereign levels where local expertise and reform energy could result in faster, more tangible benefits.  Green city and smart city initiatives are examples of sub-sovereign development that multilateral development banks could support in a more direct and integrated fashion.I also believe that development banks should adopt stronger targets for mobilizing private finance, and deploy a broader range of instruments, including guarantees and insurance products, to mobilize more private capital into their projects. This is especially true for development banks that are focused on private sector development.Third, given the scale of the challenges, the development banks must continue to explore financial innovations to responsibly stretch their existing balance sheets.The resources available to these banks are scarce and must be used most effectively.  The goal is to deliver extra financing without substituting resources away from other priorities or compromising development impact.  The G20’s recent independent review of capital adequacy of the development banks offers a number of interesting ideas.  One possibility involves freeing up capital for new lending through increased securitization of private sector projects or portfolios.  Other potential ideas include expanding sources of equity and adjustments to financial management.We must, however, be clear-eyed about how much more lending can be leveraged from current balance sheets.  Prudent financial management and financial sustainability are important for these institutions to deliver – not only today, but into the long term.  We need to preserve the ability of the institutions to borrow from markets on attractive terms and to play a countercyclical role when needed.Since the establishment of the World Bank in the aftermath of World War II, the multilateral development bank system has continuously evolved in line with the new challenges we have faced over time. We have seen the development of new, specialized institutions – like the International Development Association – to provide concessional finance to the poorest countries.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was created to nurture a nascent private sector in transition economies in Eastern Europe. The development banks have also incorporated work on new sectors and issues – such as on human capital, post-conflict reconstruction, good governance and anti-corruption, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Some of the ideas I mentioned today will be easier to implement.  Some will be harder.  All of them will require political leadership.  Progress may be incremental and non-linear, and results may take years to become fully evident.  But we must start now.Of course, global challenges like climate change will not be solved by the development banks alone, no matter how successful these reforms may be.  The scale of the problem is too big. Individual countries will need to make changes, including important policy reforms.  Advanced economies must provide quality financing, and crucially, the private sector will need to step in with investments and technology.  The Just Energy Transition Partnership being developed for a number of countries with active participation from the United States, the G7, and other partners, provides a promising new model for aligning domestic, public, private, and philanthropic resources in support of the fight against climate change.  The world cannot afford to delay or lower our ambitions.  The current challenges are urgent. That is why I, along with leaders from a broad group of countries, will be calling on World Bank management at the Annual Meetings next week to work with shareholders to develop a World Bank evolution roadmap by December.  Deeper work should begin by the spring.  Shareholders will then need to drive parallel, holistic reform efforts across other development banks as well.To accelerate this work, my team will step up our engagement with World Bank shareholders and management. And we look forward to discussing more details on this project in the coming weeks.To confront the evolving challenges facing the global economy today, we all have jobs to do at home.  In the United States and many other advanced economies, this means reining in inflation, while providing targeted support to those most impacted by rising prices.  At the same time, in addressing our global challenges, we must cooperate.  And we must listen to one another.  

Shocks from the pandemic and Russia’s terrible war have rattled the world economy.  But this is no time for us to retreat.  The world needs ambitious responses to all our problems: from policymakers, business leaders, and development officials alike.  We need ambition in how we work together to guide the global economy in the near term.  We need ambition in updating our vision for development financing and delivery.  And we need ambition in meeting our global challenges."
252,,"October 3, 2022","On behalf of the entire Council, I’d like to express my thanks and appreciation for the hard work of our staffs. And I’d like to thank members of the Council for your attention and partnership on this effort. I know that there has been tremendous effort on this report since March.The Council works to identify, address, and foster resilience to vulnerabilities in the financial system. This includes vulnerabilities arising from new and emerging technologies and sectors.In April, I delivered a speech on digital assets at American University. I argued that the government should promote responsible innovation – innovation that works for all Americans, protects our national security interests and our planet, and contributes to our economic competitiveness and growth.Innovation is also one of the hallmarks of a vibrant financial system and economy. But as we have painfully learned from history, innovation without adequate regulation can result in significant disruptions and harm to the financial system and to individuals.Digital assets have grown significantly in scale and scope over recent years. They have attracted a large amount of capital and interest from both retail and institutional investors. At the same time, we have seen very significant shocks and volatility within the crypto-assets system, particularly over the last year. With the potential for this kind of instability in mind, at our February meeting, the Council named digital assets as one of its key priorities for the year.The Council’s report we are voting on today finds that the current regulatory framework has helped largely insulate traditional financial institutions from crypto-asset-related financial stability risks. But it states that crypto-asset activities could pose risks to U.S. financial stability if their interconnections with the traditional financial system or their overall scale were to grow without adherence to or being paired with appropriate regulation, including enforcement of the existing regulatory structure.The report also identifies a number of material gaps in current regulation, and recommendations to address these gaps. Some of these recommendations are focused on actions that Council member agencies can take with existing authorities. Others require Congress to provide new authorities.This report adds to analysis of digital asset issues that have been covered in other recent reports, including on the future of money and payments; consumers and investor protection; illicit finance; and a framework for international engagement.In all, these reports provide a strong foundation for policymakers as we work to mitigate the risks of digital assets while realizing the potential benefits. They also provide a valuable addition to the public’s understanding of digital assets."
253,,"October 1, 2022","Senator Leahy, I’m grateful for your kind words. And I’m even more grateful for your leadership over your eight terms in the Senate. For decades, you have been a giant in the fight for a fair economy that works for everyone. Your work on the Lilly Ledbetter Act. Your push for equal pay for the women’s national soccer team. And your support for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. These are just a few examples of how you’ve fought for gender equality.And it’s not just here in America. You’ve worked on some of the most consequential international and humanitarian issues of the last half century. Through your leadership on the Appropriations Committee, you’ve provided aid to victims of human trafficking and those suffering the most.1Everyone here in Vermont and Washington also knows that this career in public service would not have been possible without Senator Leahy’s partnership with Marcelle. Marcelle and Patrick Leahy are partners in the truest sense of the word. Marcelle’s passion to help families is perhaps seen most aptly in her commitment to the families of those serving in the National Guard. She’s been instrumental in helping families maintain stability and continuity before, during, and following deployment. And Marcelle’s support for cancer research and public health funding has benefitted countless women across the country.2More than anywhere else, the Leahys have ensured that women’s economic opportunity has been at the forefront of the agenda in Vermont. There is no better testament to this belief than the very conference we are at today.As you know, this is the 25th Vermont Women’s Economic Opportunity Conference. Since 1996, hundreds of Vermont women have come together to discuss issues of economic empowerment. Trailblazers like Lilly Ledbetter, Sonia Sotomayor, Loretta Lynch – and of course, Marcelle Leahy – have delivered keynote addresses. What I find even more inspiring than the keynotes are the breakout sessions I’ve learned about that come after. Through practical conversations about issues of everyday importance, Vermont women talk about the various barriers and challenges they face, especially in their careers. And they support and lift each other up.These issues are of special focus to me because I’ve lived a few of them. It was almost exactly forty-one years ago that I was getting ready to re-enter the workforce after the birth of Robby, my son. I was immensely fortunate to have a spouse, also an economist, who like Marcelle, was a true partner, and in every sense of that word.  We coauthored economic research papers; and he fully shared in childcare responsibilities, often doing more than his share.  On top of that, both of us had flexible academic jobs that made it easier to balance work and family.  That’s something that most women lack.   But we still found balancing two careers with parenting challenging.  And we needed some childcare.  I remember calling the classified section of The Daily Californian and purchasing a “help wanted” advertisement for a babysitter. We indicated in the ad that we would offer “good pay.”3My husband and I were fortunate: We could pay for good childcare. And we paid even more than the market rate to make sure that we could get the right person for the important job. But, as all of us know, that’s a luxury that most people across this country do not have. And it’s part of a broader childcare system that does not work for anyone – for the kids, for the families, or for the caregivers themselves. That became clear to me and my husband. And it is clear for so many parents and families.So let me turn to the issues facing women in the workforce from the perspective of both a working mother and an economist. My case to you today is that expanding opportunity to women isn’t just the right thing to do. It’s also good economics. And we have much more work to do.Let me focus on three inequities that have been top of mind for me lately: women’s participation in our workforce, pay equity, and women’s health. I’ll then talk about what our Administration has done to expand women’s economic opportunity.First, women’s participation in our workforce. From 1950 to the end of the 20th century, the female labor force participation rate almost doubled. This was one of the major drivers of economic growth during that period.4 Yet, since 2000, the participation rate has stagnated in the U.S. – even as it has continued to rise in other advanced economies.In other words, within a generation, we’ve lost one of our major drivers of creating inclusive economic growth. And this comes as the pandemic placed added strains on certain groups of women. Economic data shows that the labor force participation rate has returned to pre-pandemic levels for prime age women – which is a huge achievement.5 But the rate for non-college-educated women has remained below what it was before the pandemic.6There are still too many barriers for women entering the workforce. Childcare continues to be a big challenge. Today, the average family with at least one child under age 5 needs to devote about 13 percent of family income to pay for childcare. This is a price far out of reach for too many Americans. And, further, the cost dissuades new mothers from entering the workforce in the first place.  We need programs that will actively support and facilitate women entering the labor market. A wide body of research has shown that high-quality, affordable childcare and free preschool increase the likelihood that parents, particularly mothers, will participate in the workforce. These programs also provide lasting benefits on the outcomes of their children. And they help the entire economy.  By one estimate, increasing the female labor participation rate to the male rate would raise GDP by 5 percent.7Second, let me now focus on pay equity. As you know, women in America who work year-round in full-time jobs earn a median of around 83 cents to every dollar earned by men.8 Even when we compare the gender gap across workers in similar occupations with comparable qualifications, research suggests there’s typically still a gap of about 10 percent.9Disparities in pay widen for women of color.One of the main reasons for the pay gap is an issue that you will discuss in the breakout sessions: the day-to-day challenges that face women across this country. As people progress in their careers, jobs can require longer hours. This has a disproportionate effect on women, who often bear a larger share of the childcare burden. These factors are relevant across the wage spectrum, including among the highest-paid jobs.  We need to be thinking about ways that government interventions like subsidized childcare can be effective in reducing the pressures on women.In all, ensuring equal pay for equal work would result in increased pay for women, boost our economy, and reduce poverty for single-parent families.10 It’s not just the right thing to do. It’s the economically beneficial thing to do.Third, let me discuss women’s health. Health outcomes are tied to economic progress.11 For instance, research shows that those likely affected by Medicaid expansion had a reduction in collections and debt owed for both health and non–health-related expenses.12There is good news: globally, maternal mortality has fallen by over a third since 2000. The bad news: it has increased in America in recent years.13 Access to care in this country has remained stubbornly tied to class, resulting in low-income and working mothers with worse treatment and poorer health outcomes than they should have. And the recent ruling by the Supreme Court only serves to exacerbate disparities in access to care. The Court’s recent decision overturning Roe v. Wade is a deeply consequential step backwards. I believe that denying women the ability to make decisions about when and whether to have children limits their ability to control their economic future and to make decisions that are best for them and their families. Access to reproductive health care has helped women join the workforce, enabled many women to finish school, and allowed women to plan and balance their families and their careers.Not all of these issues are new. Disparities in labor force participation, pay, and health have existed for decades. But it is time we fix them. And with Senator Leahy’s support, that is what the President and I have been focused on doing.The American Rescue Plan, signed into law by the President in 2021, drove a historically fast and inclusive recovery. It also provided a major investment into women’s economic opportunity. In one of our signature programs – the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds – we’ve seen states and local governments spend billions on workforce development and childcare programs. Other programs, like the State Small Business Credit Initiative and the Child Care Stabilization Grant program, have supported women-owned businesses and hard-hit childcare providers. In fact, one of the very first loans in the SSBCI program was to increase the capacity of a daycare facility just 38 miles from here.The ARP also supported families more broadly. The expanded Child Tax Credit gave families up to $3,000 per child six and older – and even more for children under six. This put money directly into the pockets of working-class and low-income moms and dads. And the Emergency Rental Assistance program provided billions in assistance to help low-income families keep up on their rent. Two-thirds of the households that received this assistance were female-headed households.Beyond direct economic support, the Biden Administration has provided support to prevent and respond to gender-based violence, including domestic violence and sexual assault services. It’s announced the development of the first-ever government-wide National Action Plan to End Gender-Based Violence. And it has pursued additional initiatives to provide women with access to quality and affordable health care coverage.There is much more work to do. I believe we must expand access to childcare, increase access to healthcare, support women’s reproductive rights, and offer additional support for women in the workforce. It’s more than just an issue of fairness. It offers economic benefits for the entire country. We will continue to advocate for these policies.This conference – and the women gathered here today – give me hope that we will be able to make progress. When I placed that ad in the classified section of The Daily Californian in 1971, a conference like this would have been unimaginable. Now, in its twenty-fifth year, the conference has become a staple.Senator Leahy and Marcelle: thank you for championing women’s economic empowerment in Vermont and across the globe. And to everyone gathered here: I look forward to our collective work to continue pushing forward and create an economy that works for everyone – particularly women in America.13 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2020/maternal-mortality-rates-2020.htm#:~:text=Rates%20in%202020%20were%2013.8,for%20women%20under%20age%2025."
254,,"September 30, 2022","WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen issued the following statement on passage of the Continuing Appropriations and Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2023:“With Congress’s vote today, the Biden-Harris Administration reaffirms our support for Ukraine with an additional $4.5 billion in economic assistance, bringing total direct budget support from the United States to $13 billion—all in grants. This new grant assistance is a further demonstration of U.S. confidence in Ukraine, and will support critical government operations and provide relief to Ukrainian people suffering under Russia’s brutal war. Critically, this funding will also help bolster Ukraine’s valiant resistance to Putin’s illegal war of aggression. We call on fellow donors to not only speed up their existing disbursements to Ukraine, but also to increase their scale of assistance. Alongside our critical economic support to the government and people of Ukraine, the Department of the Treasury will continue to use all available tools to hold Russian authorities responsible for their illegal actions in Ukraine, including through our historic sanctions coalition.”"
255,,"September 29, 2022","WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement following the announcement of a new rule on beneficial ownership reporting under the Corporate Transparency Act.“Today’s announcement is a major step forward in giving law enforcement, national security agencies, and other partners the information they need to crack down on criminals, corrupt individuals, and other bad actors who seek to take advantage of America’s financial system for illicit purposes. This rule builds on years of bipartisan work by Congress, Treasury, national security and law enforcement agencies, and other stakeholders to bolster corporate transparency while minimizing the impact of compliance on honest businesses.In doing so, this rule will make it harder for criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system. It will help strengthen our national security by making it more difficult for oligarchs, terrorists, and other global threats to use complex legal structures to launder money, traffic humans and drugs, and commit other crimes that threaten harm to the American people. And it will help level the playing field for honest businesses that play by the rules but are at a disadvantage when competing against bad actors who use shell companies to evade taxes, hide their illicit wealth, and defraud customers and employees.  On the international front, the rule will also help the U.S. more effectively combat financial crime alongside our partners and allies under strong global standards.Critically, this rule will also greatly further our Administration’s work to fight corruption and its corrosive effects on our democracy and the rule of law – both at home and around the world.”"

257,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here.

258,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

260,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
261,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1. For additional analysis on Treasury market liquidity conditions, see (for example): “Resilience redux in the Treasury Market” by Darrell Duffie (August 25, 2023) and “How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Evolved in 2023” by Michael Fleming (October 17, 2023).2. Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

262,,"September 27, 2022","Hello, everyone. I’m glad to be at Cypress Creek Renewables in North Carolina. Solar projects like the ones developed here exemplify the promise of our clean energy future.Earlier this month, in Michigan, I laid out how the President’s economic plan will strengthen our economy for decades to come. In particular, I explained how the plan will make our economy more productive and resilient – and advance economic fairness for all Americans.Today, I want to focus on a key component of the President’s economic blueprint: undertaking historic investments to fight climate change. I gave my first speech warning about the economic dangers of a warming planet almost 25 years ago. That was during the Clinton Administration. At the time, there was an established scientific consensus around the threat posed by climate change. But among the public and policymakers, an understanding of its threats – as well as the economic opportunities from a clean energy transition – was much lower than it is today. I am happy to report today that President Biden’s economic plan represents the most aggressive action that we’ve ever taken to address the climate crisis. The President has tackled the crisis head-on by securing over $430 billion to modernize our energy system. [1] These investments will accelerate the transition to our green energy future and lower energy costs for American households and businesses. They will secure our energy supply against global price shocks. And they will provide good-paying, high-quality jobs across America – particularly in non-coastal communities that have suffered from disinvestment.Of course, unmitigated climate change is an existential threat to everyone on our planet. But even short of that, it poses meaningful risks to our economy. One way that economists measure the impact of warming is as a reduction in potential output. That is, climate change decreases how much our economy can produce. In a world that continues to warm, regions that are prosperous today may eventually become unsuited for productive economic activity. In many regions, human mortality is projected to rise and labor productivity to fall, with the size of the impacts depending on the degree of warming. Quantitative estimates of climate change’s impact on GDP vary widely. This is in part due to the difficulty of modeling the tail risk of crossing irreversible climate tipping points.We do know that the harms of climate change are likely borne disproportionately by the most vulnerable populations. These are those who lack the resources to deal with the impacts. This is true both within the United States and globally. Many low-income countries are likely to be among the most severely impacted. The simple truth is that the disparate impacts of climate change raise the likely toll of human suffering.In addition to its chronic impacts, climate change can manifest itself through an increase in acute, weather-related supply shocks. These are near-term, sharp reductions in capacity that can raise prices. The reality is that shocks that were unthinkable even a few decades ago are now presenting with alarming frequency. There’s been at least a five-fold increase in the annual number of billion-dollar disasters over the past five years compared to the 1980s, even after adjusting for inflation. Here in North Carolina, you remember well the devastating toll of Hurricane Florence. That disaster killed 22 Americans. It led to $24 billion in damage and left a million North Carolinians without power.[2] And over the past week, we have seen Hurricane Fiona’s horrific impact on Puerto Rico. I know our Administration is working hard with the Puerto Rican government to get aid to those who need it.These shocks are occurring around the world. And they often have global ramifications. As an example, severe droughts and floods across the globe have hurt grain yields, contributing to the growing food security crisis.[3] In Pakistan, devastating floods have killed over a thousand people and displaced another 33 million, while also wiping out hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland. Climate change is also exacerbating energy shortages in Europe. Abnormally hot and dry conditions have reduced nuclear and hydropower electricity production in a number of countries while driving up demand for energy.Viewed through the lens of supply shocks, climate change can have a worrying effect on macroeconomic stability. Supply chain disruptions, like the ones experienced during the pandemic, may become commonplace. Businesses will likely increasingly need to invest in expensive climate-change adaptation strategies. Households, too, will likely need to increasingly devote resources to everything from higher food bills to flood insurance – while potentially dealing with diminished health and higher mortality.And climate change presents a notable challenge for governments, as well. Persistent, frequent shocks will place more strain on the need for fiscal relief. It will also limit our ability to address it by shrinking our national resources. State and local governments may increasingly be forced to devote scarce resources to disaster mitigation, potentially at the expense of investments in areas like education and worker training. And the bulk of the evidence suggests that these disasters have long-lasting negative effects on economic growth – with many economies failing to fully recover.[4]In sum, climate change poses a grave risk to the productive capacity of our economy while also impacting its stability. To tackle these risks, we need to accelerate our transition to a clean energy economy. By doing so, we will also realize significant economic opportunities in high-growth industries, while building economic resilience and creating good-paying jobs across the country.The President has called the 2020s “the decisive decade” to address climate change and avoid its worst impacts. To do our part, the United States has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least half from 2005 levels by the end of the decade. We have made significant progress – and further powered by the Inflation Reduction Act, our plan puts us on a strong course to achieve that goal.A cornerstone of the Biden Administration’s approach on climate change rests on harnessing the engagement of the private sector. Specifically, government must provide the basic foundations and long-term certainty that businesses need to invest at scale and drive the transition toward a clean energy future.Our government has long provided incentives to mobilize private capital toward compelling economic and public policy objectives. Decades of government research investment spurred the creation of the Internet. Commercial medical technologies that we take for granted – like MRIs and advanced prosthetics – were supported by government through their development. This approach extends to clean energy. In large part due to concerted government investment, costs for key renewable energy technologies have already seen declines upwards of 75% over the past decade.But this Administration understood that our existing system of programs and incentives were not sufficiently strong to help transition the economy at the pace that is needed to meet our climate goals. Nor at the pace that is required to ensure that American industries and workers benefit from the transition to the maximum extent possible.Investors lacked long-term certainty because tax credits were subject to Congressional renewal at short intervals. In the case of the tax credit for electric vehicles, it began to phase out once a manufacturer had sold 200,000 cars. There was also little, if any support, for new technologies that could help transition harder-to-abate sectors – such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. The result: the United States was at risk of being left behind in the global competition for leadership of these low-carbon technologies and industries of the future.Like a large ship, the U.S. economy requires a clear course to steer in the right direction. This means coupling long-term incentives for private investment with regulation across key sectors in order to accelerate innovation and expand the productive capacity of the economy. And that’s what the Biden economic plan delivers.The cornerstone of the plan – the Inflation Reduction Act – extends and expands the current system of clean energy tax credits. These reforms will provide greater long-term certainty for businesses on their returns on investment. The credits will also have greater reach. For the first time, non-profits and state and local governments will be able to benefit directly from them. For emerging technologies – such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture – the Inflation Reduction Act will jumpstart innovation and growth. For more established zero-emissions technologies – like the solar energy projects operated here at Cypress Creek – the law will sustain and accelerate progress that’s been made.We also expect to see lower energy costs for families. The Administration has launched a website to help Americans take advantage of a wide range of consumer tax credits. There are tax credits to lower costs for home energy efficiency improvements, such as better insulation and heat pumps – as well as new tax incentives for buying and installing energy-efficient air conditioners and furnaces in homes.But there’s more. Beyond the consumer tax credits, we expect a significant mobilization of private investment into the clean energy sector. Combined with the business tax credits, this investment is expected to further push down the costs of clean energy production. This, in turn, is expected to help bring down retail electricity rates at the same time as the law electrifies a greater share of the American economy.Modernizing our energy system means modernizing our infrastructure as well. To accommodate new clean energy production and usage, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is laying the groundwork for improvements and expansions of transmission lines. This work anticipates the potential need to triple the size of our electricity transmission systems by 2050.[5] The infrastructure law also funds the first national EV charging system. It will make 500,000 chargers available across the country.[6]What does this all mean for our economy? Through these investments, we are positioning the United States to capitalize on the growing demand for low-carbon products around the world.[7] We are establishing and extending our country’s leadership in key industrial and technology sectors.[8] We are attracting investments in companies and workers here at home – and creating high-quality, good-paying jobs across America. In the meantime, these investments boost our global effort to directly combat climate change and avoid its worst economic, social, and health fallouts.I am proud that the Treasury Department will be at the forefront of implementing our economic and climate plan. I am also proud that, as we push the ambitions of other countries to do more, I can represent the United States as a world leader in tackling the climate crisis with greater credibility than ever before.Over the past two years in particular, we’ve seen the direct consequences of our continued dependence on fossil fuels. Not only do we continue to contribute and subject ourselves to a rapidly warming climate. But we expose ourselves to the type of energy market volatility we’ve experienced in the wake of Russia’s brutal war on Ukraine.No country controls the wind and the sun. And countries that can harness those sources of energy will make their economies more resilient and secure. That’s exactly what we’re doing with the Inflation Reduction Act. We are shifting our dependence to clean sources and away from the volatility of fossil fuels and the autocratic regimes that often control them. The law also incentivizes investment – here at home – in solar panels, batteries, and other key components of the energy supply chain. This helps secure critical inputs needed to deliver on our clean energy future.Our plan also dedicates $50 billion to strengthen the resilience of our infrastructure against the increasing number and severity of extreme weather events. These investments will help protect America’s farmers, homeowners, and communities against droughts, floods, and extreme heat.Lastly, our sustainable future must be fair and inclusive. Within days of taking office, the President established the Justice40 initiative, which aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits of federal climate and environmental remediation investments to disadvantaged communities.[9] In line with that commitment, our plan provides funds to help clean up hazardous waste and pollution in local communities that have been most harmed by them.[10] This will lift a barrier that has held back health and economic outcomes in these communities.At the same time, our plan will spur new economic opportunity for cities, towns, and rural areas that have been overlooked. For too long, economic opportunity has been disproportionately concentrated on the coasts. But clean energy creates opportunities across the country. This includes non-coastal areas and communities that have been historically dependent on fossil fuel extraction.[11] In fact, the Inflation Reduction Act provides additional tax incentives for businesses to invest in low-income and historic energy communities, with strong labor standards as a key requirement. These new opportunities will add to the billions in federal investments that the Biden Administration is already making in communities hard-hit by coal mine and power plant closures.In sum, the transition to a clean economy has massive economic stakes for the United States and the world. We need to mitigate against the risks and capitalize on the economic opportunities. But there’s a personal imperative to act too. It’s often said that how well we tackle this crisis is a test of whether we can come together to preserve the planet for our children. But from what I’ve seen over the past few years – with the growing severity of the disasters that have struck the United States – this is no longer just about our children.Treasury, the IRS, and other agencies across the Administration are already hard at work to implement the Biden economic plan. In the coming weeks, Treasury will engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders on key provisions. My team and I will host a series of roundtable discussions to help inform our efficient and effective implementation of the tax credits. We are working expeditiously to provide clarity and certainty so the law’s climate and economic benefits can be felt as quickly as possible, while providing effective guardrails to ensure that the benefits are delivered as intended.For decades, the world has been too slow to act. But strong action by the federal government is finally here. While there is much more to do, I believe we now have a clear and robust plan forward. I am confident about the direction of the sustainable future that we are building together."
263,,"September 16, 2022","First, I’d like to thank the Minister and Indonesia for their leadership of the G20 this year, and particularly their G20 Presidency’s focus on pressing global concerns like pandemic preparedness through the World Bank’s new Financial Intermediary Fund, as well as advancing food security around the world.I was pleased to be able to attend the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in Bali and meet with you in July and look forward to additional conversations this year. Under the leadership of Minister Luhut, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani, and other senior Indonesian officials, the Government of Indonesia—with the support of the U.S., Japan, and other donor countries—is working to accelerate Indonesia’s transition to a cleaner energy future through an emerging Just Energy Transition Partnership.Minister Luhut’s team and the U.S. team, along with our Japanese partners, recently concluded productive meetings in Jakarta.  The teams discussed Indonesia’s continued efforts to develop and implement an ambitious strategy to transition its power sector.  The United States and our donor country partners are prepared to support such a strategy with significant amounts of financial support over several years.My team also stressed that there is a considerable amount of private capital that is prepared to invest in Indonesia’s energy transition – and in its renewable energy sector in particular – if they receive continued clear and strong policy signals.  In this regard, we were pleased to see that, earlier this week, President Jokowi issued the Presidential Decree on Renewable Energy. While we are still going through the details of the Decree, it is clear that it represents some important steps forward.I am also encouraged by Minister Luhut’s commitment to ensuring that the transition drives jobs and innovation, while being just and equitable for workers impacted by the energy transition and vulnerable communities.I would note that, as Indonesia demonstrates its ongoing commitment to a just transition, the United States is doing the same.  With the recent enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act – which is our country’s biggest-ever investment in fighting climate change – the United States is now on a strong pathway to meeting our emissions reductions targets while catalyzing jobs in fast-growing industries.  And critically, the law contains specific provisions aimed at incentivizing investments in low-income and disadvantaged communities that are most vulnerable to the transition.Finally, I look forward to other topics of discussion today, such as ways that we can address the high costs of energy that are a concern in the U.S. and globally.  That includes by maintaining stable energy prices and a steady flow of oil onto international markets in the short term, even as we make investments in preventing future price spikes and our collective energy security through tools like the Just Energy Transition Partnerships and the Inflation Reduction Act. "
264,,"September 16, 2022","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury today published three reports pursuant to Sections 4, 5 and 7 of President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14067 on “Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets.” The reports address the future of money and payment systems, consumer and investor protection and illicit finance risks.“Innovation is one of the hallmarks of a vibrant financial system and economy.  But as we have learned painfully from the past, innovation without appropriately addressing the impact of these developments can result in significant disruptions and harm to the financial system and individuals, especially our more vulnerable populations. The reports clearly identify the real challenges and risks of digital assets used for financial services.  At the same time, if these risks are mitigated, digital assets and other emerging technologies could offer significant opportunities.

265,,"September 15, 2022","I would first like to acknowledge the IRS leaders who are here with us today. Thank you, also, to Commissioner Rettig, who is in Memphis today celebrating the 50th anniversary of the IRS facility there. I’m grateful for his hard work and leadership.I just finished a tour of the technology facilities at the New Carrollton Federal Building. These facilities are a model for the IT modernization that has long been needed at the IRS. Today, I want to spend some time discussing how the new IRS funding in the Inflation Reduction Act will make these types of investments possible – as well as its impact on the American economy.As our nation’s revenue collection agency, the IRS is a foundation of our government and society. The IRS collects 96% of the revenue that funds the federal government – supporting our priorities from national security to infrastructure to social security.[1] It also is one of the very few parts of the federal government that touches nearly every American household.IRS employees are known for their extraordinary dedication to public service. They have always served with distinction. But over the past couple of years, the employees of the IRS have been called to step up – even further – to serve the American people. While the country sheltered in place, many of you made sure the business of government continued. You worked long hours to deliver relief to American households. This includes three rounds of Economic Impact Payments and the monthly Child Tax Credit.[2] The work that you did ensured families got through a once-in-a-century event. And, in the case of the expanded Child Tax Credit, your work is said to had cut child poverty in half.You managed to deliver on these historic new programs while simultaneously fulfilling your tax administration responsibilities. But during the pandemic, even filing season was far from routine. For instance, on one day last year – March 15 – the IRS received 8.6 million phone calls.[3] This is over 20 percent of the phone calls that the IRS received in the entire year of 2019. Many of you are now working very hard to return the pandemic backlog of unprocessed returns to normal, healthy levels by the end of the year.You dealt with the unprecedented demand and uncertainty that came with being the nation’s tax administrator over the past two years. And you did it while the pandemic was surely disrupting your personal lives and you were called to juggle more responsibilities at home.I’ve heard so many stories of IRS employees who went above and beyond. During the start of the pandemic, from Andover to New Carrollton, your teams mounted an all-hands-on-deck effort to keep the IRS operational. For some facilities, this meant an extensive clean-up effort and provision of PPE to keep employees safe. For others, it meant sending hundreds of laptop bundles, including cables, power cords, and headsets, to enable employees to work remotely. I’ve also heard that one of your colleagues – a U.S. air force veteran – has long donated his time to provide free tax preparation services to his community. But during the pandemic, he went even further. He spent his Economic Impact Payments on additional laptops to build out the tax assistance site – so that more people could get help.And these stories are just the beginning. Just last month, here in New Carrollton, I heard that a team of your software developers completed the conversion of more than 200,000 lines of Assembly Language Code to Java. This is widely recognized as one of the most complex modernization efforts in all of government. And your team completed it more than a month ahead of schedule. I know many of you have worked weekends and traveled across the country to provide tax filing assistance to thousands of taxpayers. These are people who would otherwise not have had any help.So thank you. I want you to know how much I appreciate the work that you do. And I want you to hear from me: that especially amid the recent rise in deeply unfair and dangerous misinformation and threats, there is nothing more important to me than for you to be able to safely carry out your critical job for the American people.The work of the IRS is essential to our government and our country. So I’m glad that the President and I were able to secure $80 billion in new funding for the agency. Let me explain what this new funding will go toward – as well as how it will build a stronger and fairer economy.For decades, the IRS has been severely underfunded. Since 2010, the agency’s budget has declined by 18 percent in real terms.[4] This has had a severe impact on the size of the IRS workforce. Even though the filing population has grown significantly, the workforce is now the same size as it was in the 1970s – with fewer auditors than at any time since World War II.[5]Because of this, the IRS has had to scrape to get by. The IRS remains, in large part, a paper-based agency. Employees still open, and in some cases, transcribe paper returns by hand. Because of budget shortfalls, long-term modernization often must be cast aside to give employees bandwidth to address more immediate and urgent projects. Facing uncertain budgets year after year, the IRS is often forced to freeze external hiring or otherwise face risks that they cannot pay who they hire. This leads to delays for the American people and a reduced level of service.The American public – and you – deserve an IRS that meets its expectations in a modern society. That includes getting phone calls answered, solving problems online, and receiving refunds more expeditiously. America deserves an IRS that has first-rate technology instead of a half-century-old programming language as the backbone of its systems.And tax filing should be simple: I recently came across a statistic that it takes an average American 13 hours to file a tax return.[6] Compare that with Sweden. There, some taxpayers can file simply by replying to a text message. We can and must do better.The Inflation Reduction Act finally provides the funding to transform the IRS into a 21st century agency. While all the improvements won’t be done overnight, taxpayers can expect to feel real differences during the next filing season. Today, I’m announcing specific progress we’ll deliver on.First, it’s critical that all Americans – especially those in the working and middle class – can get tax help at an in-person location when they need it. For too long, IRS Tax Assistance Centers have been massively understaffed and under-resourced. No longer. By next year, every single center will be fully staffed. As a result, we will triple the number of Americans served at these centers. Last year, the IRS served around 900,000 Americans face-to-face. In the coming filing season, the IRS is projected to serve at least 2.7 million Americans.Second, due to chronic understaffing and high call volume, the IRS has been unable to provide the level of phone service that taxpayers deserve. During the most recent filing season, the IRS averaged a 10-15% level of service, meaning that it answered less than 2 of every 10 calls. In this coming filing season, we are committing the IRS to an 85% level of service. That means that over five times the number of calls will be answered. By hiring 5,000 additional customer service representatives, we will also cut phone wait times in half – from an average wait of nearly 30 minutes during the 2022 filing season to less than 15 minutes.[7] We will dedicate a team to resolving issues that arise when processing returns for taxpayers.Third, the IRS will firmly move into the digital age. Today, employees at the IRS still manually transcribe many paper returns. In this coming filing season, the IRS will automate the scanning of millions of individual paper returns into a native digital copy. For taxpayers, this means faster processing and faster refunds. The IRS will also build online capabilities to enable taxpayers to fully interact with the agency digitally. Currently, when taxpayers receive a notice from the IRS, they generally must respond via mail.[8] During this coming filing season, millions of taxpayers will be able to receive and respond to notices online.Fourth, to lay the groundwork for the future, I’ll convene industry-leading customer service experts from the private sector to make sure we hear their perspectives on the IRS modernization effort. We recognize that customer service in the future will look differently than customer service today. Consulting these experts – and employees at the IRS – will help us sketch out our vision of what the IRS of the next decade looks like.The world has become more complex. Enforcing tax laws is not as simple as it was a few decades ago. Average tax returns for large corporations now reach 6,000 pages. And more complicated partnerships have skyrocketed from less than 5% of total income in 1990 to over a third today.[9]As a result, the tax gap – the amount of unpaid taxes – has grown to enormous levels. It’s estimated at $7 trillion over the next decade.[10] And since the IRS has lacked the resources to effectively audit high earners – whose audits are more complex and take more time – these high earners are responsible for a disproportionate share of unpaid taxes.To illustrate: In 2019, the top one percent of Americans was estimated to owe over a fifth of unpaid taxes – totaling around $160 billion.[11] Data shows that less than half of all taxes from more complex sources of income are paid. Yet nearly all taxes due from wages and salaries – which are earned by ordinary Americans – are paid.[12]In sum, high earners are paying far less than they owe. This means that working families are shouldering a disproportionate burden of investing in our roads, schools, military, and more.This inequity is unacceptable. As leaders and employees at the IRS have warned for years now, enforcement of the law is not only a means to raise revenue. It is also a matter of fundamental fairness. It is important for honest taxpayers to know that, when they file their taxes accurately with the IRS, other people are doing the same.With your help, funding from the Inflation Reduction Act will go toward correcting this two-tiered tax system, where high earners play by different rules than working and middle-class families. Specifically, funding will go toward auditing more high earners who have not paid their full bill. With it, we are estimated to raise hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue.Importantly, I’ve directed that enforcement resources will not be used to raise audit rates for households making under $400,000 a year relative to historical levels. In fact, we expect audit rates for honest taxpayers to decline, once the IRS has the right technological infrastructure in place. This means a simpler tax filing season for taxpayers who are doing everything right.Last week, I gave an economic speech discussing how our administration’s plan will create a stronger, more resilient economy with greater fairness for all. I believe that adequately funding the IRS is core to our success. It raises the revenue for us to make important investments in our economic strength. It makes sure that all Americans are playing by the same rules. It avoids misallocation of resources in the economy at large. And it does so by deterring taxpayers from shifting their activities toward more opaque sources or engaging in tax evasion.In all, a strong IRS is critical to the economic success of this country – and I am heartened that we are finally reflecting that in our funding decisions.Over the coming weeks and months, you will be asked, yet again, to meet the moment. As with all big things, it will be difficult – but I hope it will be mostly exciting.You will help create a modernized IRS that serves people efficiently, collects taxes that are owed, and delivers credits and benefits to those who are entitled to them. You will be called to implement the Inflation Reduction Act’s new corporate tax reforms and the green tax credits, which are the largest investment in fighting climate change in our nation’s history. Soon enough, you will begin gearing up for the next tax filing season, with a mandate – and finally, resources – to properly serve the American people the way they deserve."
266,,"September 15, 2022","WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden issued an Executive Order reflecting the evolving national security threat landscape and underscoring the critical role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS or the Committee) in responding to new and emerging threats and vulnerabilities in the context of foreign investment. The Executive Order elaborates and expands on the existing list of factors that CFIUS considers when reviewing transactions for national security risks and describes potential national security implications in key areas. Among other things, the Executive Order enumerates sectors in which supply chain resiliency and U.S. technological leadership face an increasing national security risk — including microelectronics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, advanced clean energy, and critical materials. The Executive Order also directs CFIUS to consider whether a transaction that it is reviewing implicates specific national security risks related to aggregate industry investment trends, cybersecurity, and U.S. persons’ sensitive data.“President Biden’s Executive Order highlights CFIUS’s increasing attention to national security risks in several key areas and sharpens the Committee’s focus on protecting America’s national security, while maintaining the U.S. open investment policy,” said Secretary Janet L. Yellen, who serves as chair of CFIUS. “Strengthening our supply chains and protecting against foreign threats enhances our national security, and this Executive Order highlights CFIUS’s important role in that work. It also reaffirms CFIUS’s mission to protect America’s technological leadership and the security of our citizens’ sensitive data from emerging threats.”The Executive Order builds upon the illustrative list of national security factors in CFIUS’s authorizing statute (section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended) and reflects the evolving nature of national security risks that CFIUS addresses under its current authorities. While the Executive Order provides important context for how CFIUS considers these risks when evaluating the transactions under its jurisdiction, it does not change CFIUS operations or process.In particular, the Executive Order elaborates on two national security factors contained in the authorizing statute relating to supply chain resiliency and security, and U.S. technological leadership. The Executive Order highlights key sectors where these factors can present a particular risk, including microelectronics, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and biomanufacturing, quantum computing, advanced clean energy, climate adaptation technologies, critical materials, and elements of the agriculture industrial base.The Executive Order also describes three additional national security factors that CFIUS considers in reviewing transactions under its jurisdiction. The first, aggregate industry investment trends — which refers to the possibility that a foreign person may gradually gain control in a sector or technology through a series of transactions over time — implicates national security risks arising from an individual transaction that may not be apparent when the transaction is viewed in isolation. The second, cybersecurity, involves national security risks posed by malicious actors who are developing capabilities to conduct cyber intrusions or other malicious cyber-enabled activity. The third, risks related to sensitive data, recognizes that data is of increasing value as it can be used for surveillance, tracing, tracking, and targeting of individuals or groups of individuals. Each of these three factors requires particular attention from CFIUS to protect U.S. national security."
267,,"September 14, 2022","WASHINGTON — Today, the Group of Creditors of Ukraine, including the United States, concluded a Memorandum of Understanding to implement Ukraine’s request for a coordinated suspension of debt service through the end of 2023.  The suspension of debt service by official creditors will ease liquidity pressures on Ukraine and allow its government to increase social, health, and economic spending in the face of Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression.“Today, we delivered on our commitment to Ukraine for a debt service deferral that will allow the Government of Ukraine to direct additional resources toward its domestic needs and the welfare of the Ukrainian people.  As with our budget support to Ukraine totaling $8.5 billion, the debt service deferral is one more way in which the United States stands with Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s brutal war,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen.  “I urge all other official bilateral creditors to join us in supporting Ukraine as it defends itself.  I also welcome the support from private creditors during Ukraine’s time of need.”"
268,,"September 12, 2022","I want to particularly welcome the Tribal leaders and community members who are here with us today. Whether you are joining in person or virtually, thank you for being a part of today’s event.  I would like to acknowledge Interior Secretary Haaland and members of the Treasury Tribal Advisory Committee for being with us today. Former Treasurer Rosie Rios, welcome back to the Treasury Department. And of course, a special welcome to Chief Malerba’s family, who is here with us.One of the great joys of my job is getting to swear exceptional leaders into office. Not only because I gain a new colleague. But because the oath that they take is a sacred reminder to all of us that we assume the offices of public trust for one reason: to help and serve the public.Today, we are swearing in Chief Lynn Malerba as the next Treasurer of the United States. Appointed by President Biden, Chief Malerba is the first Native American to serve as Treasurer. Soon – for the first time in our history – a Native woman’s signature will be on our nation’s currency.Since 1775 – even before the establishment of the Treasury Department – the Treasurer has served a critical role in safeguarding our nation’s economic wellbeing.1  In recent decades, the Treasurer has worked closely with the talented leadership and professionals at the U.S. Mint, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and other key institutions. The Treasurer has also been a key liaison to underserved communities across the country on matters of financial security and economic inclusion. These responsibilities are broad and important.Yet Chief Malerba is taking on even more. She is leading the newly established Office of Tribal and Native Affairs, which is charged with coordinating Tribal policy and engagement across the Department. We are establishing this office with Chief Malerba at the helm because we know that – for all our progress – there is more work to do to strengthen our nation-to-nation relationship with Tribal governments. Even before the pandemic hit, the poverty rate for Native Americans was twice the national average.2  Tribal citizens had a higher unemployment rate than any other racial group.3  These economic disparities were rooted in prior federal policy, and they were only exacerbated by COVID-19. I believe we currently stand at an important moment in the relationship between the federal government and Indian Country. In the two and a half years since the pandemic hit, the Treasury Department has been tasked with distributing a historic amount of relief and investment into Tribal nations – including over $30 billion in direct aid to Tribal governments. As I saw in my visit to the Rosebud Indian Reservation in June, these funds have literally saved lives by helping fight the pandemic. They have also addressed longstanding needs in Tribal communities, such as affordable housing and broadband access. But just as important as what we did was how we did it. As we invested in Tribal communities, we sought to strengthen the trust between Treasury and Indian Country by expanding our direct engagement. And through these engagements, we listened. The feedback that we received from Tribal leaders improved the design and execution of our recovery programs.The new Office of Tribal and Native Affairs will build on this progress. We have staffed the office with Tribal citizens who have worked over the past year and a half to administer recovery programs. This office will serve as a hub for Treasury’s portfolio of issues related to Indian Country. It will lead Treasury’s nation-to-nation diplomacy on issues regarding the economic security of Tribal nations. It will provide expertise internally across policy offices and Bureaus, and push for increased interagency collaboration and cooperation on Tribal economic development. The office is a key part of the historic actions that the Biden administration has taken to support Tribal communities. The administration’s approach is rooted in our respect for – and commitment toward – our nation-to-nation relationship, trust and treaty responsibilities, and Tribal sovereignty and self-determination. There are few more suited for the challenge of leading this office than Chief Malerba.  
As many of you know, Chief Malerba is the 18th and lifetime chief of the Mohegan Tribe. She made history as the first woman chief in the Tribe’s modern history. And even as we welcome her into this new role, I am glad to say that Chief Malerba is no stranger to Treasury. Chief Malerba was an inaugural member of Treasury’s Tribal Advisory Committee, a seven-member committee that advises the Treasury Secretary on Tribal taxation and related issues. I have greatly appreciated her advice in that role. And I am grateful to have even more of her counsel in this new one.Chief Malerba – congratulations on your appointment to this office. I am looking forward to working together to build a strong and inclusive economy that works for everyone."
269,,"August 12, 2022","""Today is an historic day for our country and our economy. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will make America more competitive, lower health and energy costs for families, create high-quality jobs, bolster our energy security, sharply lower emissions, reduce the budget deficit, and increase long-term economic growth. It also upholds President Biden’s commitment to ensure families earning less than $400,000 per year do not see any tax increase. I applaud members of both chambers who have worked diligently to send this bill to President Biden for signature.When President Biden took office, our economy had been brought to a standstill by a once-in-a-generation pandemic. Through our Administration’s fiscal response, we experienced the fastest recovery in history with the strongest labor market post-World War II. This legislation, combined with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS Act, will usher in the next phase of America’s economic future. Importantly, it contains the largest investment in fighting climate change in our country’s history—an investment that will create thousands of new jobs, protect households from global energy shocks, and lower costs for American consumers.This legislation also takes a critical step toward correcting our two-tiered tax system to ensure large corporations and high-income earners cannot avoid paying the taxes they owe. Reversing the long-term deterioration in IRS funding and will help Treasury fulfill its commitment to closing the tax gap, restoring fairness to the tax code, and providing compliant taxpayers with the IRS support they deserve."""
270,,"August 4, 2022","I’m really excited to be here today to talk with leaders from both business and labor about how important it is for Congress to pass the Inflation Reduction Act.Actually, I convened businesses leaders myself yesterday to discuss this important legislation. It will address the cost of prescription drugs and health care for millions of Americans, and lower energy costs and bolster our energy security so we don’t have to rely on autocrats like Putin. This would be the biggest investment in fighting climate change in our country’s history. And this isn’t just going to protect us from global energy shocks like we’ve seen from Russia’s illegal invasion, it’s also going to create good-paying jobs across our country to power that work.I also think it’s important to talk about the revenue streams that make these investments possible and that means adequately funding the IRS so they can enforce our existing tax laws.The vast majority of businesses and workers are playing by the rules, but some aren’t, and estimates show that the “tax gap” from the top one percent of earners alone is as much as $160 billion each year.Making sure we have the resources to ensure the wealthiest among us can’t avoid paying the taxes they owe that’s about restoring basic fairness and ending a two-tiered system. It’s about making sure we can invest in addressing those key household expenses and making our economy stronger.I think it's important to underscore that this legislation is fiscally responsible. It will actually reduce the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars over time.And by reducing deficits, we’ll be complementing the work the Federal Reserve and the Administration is doing to combat inflation, even as we address these cost pressures like health care, prescription drugs, and energy.So that’s why we hope Congress will pass this bill as soon as possible, and it’s why you saw five of my predecessors at the Treasury Department – Secretaries who served under Democrats and under Republicans – call for the same this week."
271,,"July 28, 2022","WASHINGTON — Today, Vice President Kamala Harris announced a new coordinated effort by six federal agencies – the Departments of the Treasury, Commerce, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Agriculture and the Small Business Administration— to maximize federal dollars flowing into underserved communities, including communities of color, rural, and Tribal communities. These federal agencies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to enhance and expand their collective efforts to strengthen access to public-and private-sector capital to address longstanding economic disparities in underserved communities, building on the historic investments in the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and other statutes.As part of this effort to enhance investment in underserved communities, Vice President Harris also announced the formation of a newly created Economic Opportunity Coalition, a coalition of leading private sector, philanthropic, and community organizations that has committed tens of billions of dollars and other resources to strengthen community finance organizations, especially community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions (MDIs); support small businesses in underserved communities, especially minority entrepreneurship; broaden financial inclusion and provision of financial services in underserved communities; and leverage investments in infrastructure to improve access and mobility and create more community wealth.Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen issued the following statement on the Memorandum of Understanding and formation of the Economic Opportunity Coalition:“The Treasury Department is committed to unlocking the economic potential of communities of color, low-income neighborhoods, rural areas, and other historically underserved communities. These efforts will help build a stronger and more globally competitive U.S. economy where all Americans have a chance to succeed. Increasing economic opportunity for historically marginalized communities will contribute to our nation’s broader economic growth and benefits the whole country. The public and private sector each have key roles to play in addressing longstanding economic disparities and these initiatives will help us each to further our impact by deploying our resources side-by-side and more collaboratively. I welcome the formation of the Economic Opportunity Coalition and the commitments being announced by its founding members today. These initiatives will enable the federal government to expand access to public and private sector capital and to build on the historic investments available under the American Rescue Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and other effort.These programs are a down payment on the investment needed to unlock the full potential of all communities, and I look forward to working with our partners across the federal government and the private sector to deepen our commitment to serving the American people.”As part of today’s announcement, the Department of the Treasury also reported progress on several key initiatives focused on these goals. Through the Emergency Capital Investment Program, the Department of the Treasury has made approximately $8.26 billion of investments so far in 161 CDFIs and MDIs to enhance their ability to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, especially in low-income and underserved communities. Treasury’s State Small Business Credit Initiative is in the process of deploying nearly $10 billion to states, the District of Columbia, territories, and Tribal governments to empower small businesses to access capital needed to invest in job-creating opportunities. Finally, Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund recently released the notice of funding availability for the $1.75 billion CDFI Equitable Recovery Program, after having delivered $1.25 billion in 2021 through the CDFI Rapid Response Program."

Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
273,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
274,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
275,,"November 21, 2023",
276,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
277,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

278,,"July 20, 2022","WASHINGTON — Today, the Group of Creditors of Ukraine, including the United States, announced their intent to honor Ukraine’s request for a coordinated suspension of debt service through the end of 2023. A suspension of debt service will provide substantial support for the Government and people of Ukraine in the face of Russia’s unjustified and unprovoked war of aggression.“I welcome this initiative of the group of official creditors to Ukraine, including the United States, who stand ready to provide a debt service deferral to Ukraine,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen.  “I reiterate the call to all other bilateral official and private creditors to join this initiative and assist Ukraine as it defends itself from Russia’s unprovoked and brutal war, which has had a devastating impact on Ukraine’s people and economy, with spillover effects throughout the world.”"
279,,"July 19, 2022","Thank you for the opportunity to tour the Science Park today and get a first-hand view of the work and innovation that companies like LG are doing here.Facilities such as these testify to the dynamism of the Korean economy.  The ingenuity and industriousness seen here help explain how Korea has grown to become one of the most productive economies in the world.That ingenuity is shared by workers and entrepreneurs both in the United States and in Korea. It is what has made our two countries such strong economic partners and close allies over the years.Our economic partnership continues to grow, including Korean investments in the U.S.: LG recently announced investments in electric car battery plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee.While Samsung has announced plans to build a major semiconductor chip factory in Texas. Meanwhile, the United States has bolstered its investments and partnerships with Korea, including:And the POSCO  and GM partnership, where the two companies are diversifying their supply chain production for battery inputs with factories in Korea, Europe, and Canada.By deepening our economic ties and making our supply chains more resilient, we’re seeking to resolve the sort of bottlenecks that are raising prices for consumers in both of our countries.As anyone who has tried to buy a car recently can tell you, global shortages across supply chains are raising prices. Auto companies will tell you about how those same shortages are slowing down production and idling factory lines. And that’s true in far too many sectors of our economy, where challenges in our supply chains are fueling the inflation that Americans are feeling in their day-to-day life.But by working with key allies like Korea to develop stronger supply chains for key components like EV batteries or semiconductors, we can make both of our economies stronger and help ease the blockages that have led to higher prices and delays for American workers and businesses. Supply chain resilience is a key focus of the Biden-Harris Administration.  The necessity of this work has been illustrated clearly by the events of the past two years – first by COVID-19 and our efforts to fight the pandemic, and now by Russia’s brutal war of aggression in Ukraine.  Together, they have redrawn the contours of global supply chains and trade.Economic integration has been weaponized by Russia to great effect.  Right now, Russia is threatening to spark a global food crisis by blocking ports in Ukraine, and its invasion of Ukraine has already caused energy prices to rise in America and across the world.That is why the United States and other responsible allies and partners are seeking to reduce Russia’s revenue to wage its war, without causing unnecessary volatility in global energy markets.  We seek to impose a price cap on Russian oil exports.  By imposing a price cap on Russian oil exports, we can deny Putin the money he needs to fund his war of choice, while dampening high gas and energy prices we’re seeing around the world.  And at a time in which inflation is unacceptably high in the United States, the price cap is one of the most powerful tools we have to address the high cost of gas.These recent shocks to the global economy have refocused global attention on the importance of economic resilience and addressing supply chain vulnerabilities.  Working with allies and partners through “friend-shoring” is an important element of strengthening economic resilience while sustaining the dynamism and productivity growth that comes with economic integration.  Friend-shoring is about deepening relationships and diversifying our supply chains with a greater number of trusted trading partners to lower risks for our economy and theirs.In doing so, we can help to insulate both American and Korean households from the price increases and disruptions caused by geopolitical and economic risks and facilitate our businesses’ access to vital inputs and products – from medicine to semiconductors to electric vehicle batteries.In that sense, we can continue to strengthen the international system we have benefitted from, while also protecting ourselves from the fragilities in global trade networks that we have seen over the last few years. On the domestic side, we are investing in our ports, airports, highways, waterways, and clean energy infrastructure thanks to the historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.This is legislation that will invest in supply chain resiliency, in the R&D and commercialization of new technologies, and in making more semiconductors in the United States. The failure to make those investments in the past has resulted in bottlenecks throughout the U.S.  economy – particularly in the automotive sector – that workers and consumers are paying the price for now.Even as the United States makes investments to expand domestic production capacity for some critical products, as I mentioned earlier, we must work with allies and partners to secure supplies of critical goods that we will not make in sufficient quantities at home.  We must work with America’s allies and partners to strengthen our collective supply chain resilience, while ensuring that high standards for labor and environmental practices are upheld.The United States is also pursuing supply chain resilience objectives through international forums such as the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, and other regional and bilateral initiatives.The United States has taken steps to work with the private sector and leverage financial and development tools to promote supply chain diversification.  To make our supply chains more resilient we need to maintain strong economic ties with critical allies like Korea, while lessening the risks associated with the over-concentration of key supplies in unreliable countries.We do not want a retreat from the world, causing us to forego the benefits it brings to the American people and the markets for our businesses and exports.  By taking a more strategic, long-term view of the vulnerabilities in our economic relationships, we can ensure that the trade we engage in will continue to make our economies more innovative, productive, and resilient.Of course, economic resilience is not just about trade and investment ties.  Russia’s illegal war with Ukraine has also underscored just how vulnerable we are to global energy shocks.Even as we work to expand the supply of oil and gas in the short term to lower prices at the pump in America and around the world, this is a reminder of the importance of accelerating the global transition to clean, renewable sources of energy in the medium to long-term.  Having domestic sources of renewable energy means we won’t be at the whims of authoritarians like Vladimir Putin, even as we lower emissions and energy costs.It also means at the facilities here – and in the factories I mentioned that are being built across the United States in Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, Georgia, and Texas – we are building the backbone for the world’s transition to a greener economy and the new green jobs of the future.In particular, the supply of electric vehicle batteries that LG is helping to secure with their investments in America are vital for these intertwined goals of bolstering manufacturing, lowering energy costs, and reducing emissions.We must also strive to make the United States and our partners and allies safe from the arbitrary and politically motivated actions that constitute economic coercion.As Korea knows well, economic integration with certain countries can come with heavy costs.  Trade dependencies can give authoritarian regimes leverage to extract concessions and undermine the rules-based international economic order.  They can even put democratic governments – who are accountable to the citizens that elected them – at the mercy of bullying by authoritarian leaders who can subject their citizens to painful economic costs. Countries across the Indo-Pacific, and throughout the global economy, remain vulnerable to countries using their market positions in raw materials, technology, or products to exercise geopolitical leverage or disrupt markets and trading activities for unrelated reasons.One such example is China, which has directed significant resources to seek a dominant position in the manufacturing of certain advanced technologies, including semiconductors, while employing a range of unfair trade practices to achieve this position.  One of the ways we can address this is by modernizing our approach to trade integration by properly taking into account externalities arising from concentration of supply chains, geopolitical concerns, and value – rather than overly focusing on cost.   We ought to try to preserve the best features of that system—one that has been beneficial to the United States and our allies—while working to address the real problems that have emerged, including the unfair Chinese practices that damage our national-security interests.In modernizing the multilateral trading system, our objective is to achieve free and secure trade that benefits our workers, businesses, and consumers. We cannot allow countries like China to use their market position in key raw materials, technologies, or products to disrupt our economy or exercise unwanted geopolitical leverage. The United States and our allies, like Korea, will work together to continue to demand strong adherence to norms and values that have underpinned the international economic order.  We will impose harsh consequences on those countries that abuse or break that order, as we have demonstrated with our unprecedented response to Russia’s aggression.  And we will work with allies and partners through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework to help lower costs by making our supply chains more resilient in the long term.  I want to thank the workers here and in the United States for deepening the long-standing partnership and alliance between the United States and Korea.The Biden-Harris Administration will continue to work with our partners and allies to strengthen the vibrancy and resilience of our economic relationships."
280,,"July 19, 2022","The United States deeply values our close partnership with Korea. Korea is a longstanding ally and close friend to the United States. It is a flourishing democracy with a vibrant economy. Our close friendship with Korea is guided by shared values and mutual respect.Korea is the world’s tenth largest economy and a pivotal producer of key high-tech goods. I look forward to discussing urgent issues with Deputy Prime Minister Choo, including economic security and supply chains. Making our economies and supply chains more resilient will help protect us against costly disruptions that lead to higher prices and adversely impact our workers, consumers, and businesses. Right now, countries around the world are experiencing that acutely because of Russia’s war in Ukraine and the ongoing effects of the pandemic.We will also discuss our ongoing efforts to hold Russia to account for its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine – including by exploring a price cap on Russia oil to deprive Russia of oil revenues and to lower oil prices for consumers.Russia’s illegal war and the global energy shock that has followed has underscored the need to protect ourselves from dependence on foreign oil that makes us vulnerable to the whims of authoritarians like Vladimir Putin. I look forward to discussing our efforts to support the green transition at home and abroad in a way that protects consumers and lowers emissions in line with our climate commitments.At the same time, the United States and Republic of Korea continue to work in lockstep to limit North Korea’s continued development and proliferation of its nuclear and missile programs.I am confident that we will continue to work together to meet these challenges to secure economic growth and security in the United States, Korea, and across the Indo-Pacific. I look forward to working closely with you, Deputy Prime Minister Choo, as we address these challenges going forward."
281,,"July 15, 2022","We are meeting at an extremely difficult time for global food security, which was already under pressure from conflict, climate change, and economic shocks associated with COVID-19.Now, Russia’s war against Ukraine has exacerbated those challenges and led to a global crisis of food insecurity as prices spiked for food, fertilizer, and fuel.  Putin’s actions, including the destruction of agricultural facilities, theft of grain and farm equipment, and the effective blockade of Black Sea ports, amount to using food as a weapon of war.Those most directly impacted are the poorest households in the poorest countries.  Families that already spend a disproportionate share of their income on food are forced to make stark choices.  Low-income countries that already face severe fiscal constraints struggle to import enough food and fertilizer and to provide even the most basic social safety net to their people.  These effects are setting back development and undermining efforts to eradicate poverty.We must take action to address the short-term food insecurity crisis and, equally importantly, the longer-term drivers of food insecurity, including the nexus with climate change.  The speed and wisdom of our decisions now will make the difference on whether we get the current crisis under control.The G20 must work together to tackle these challenges and protect vulnerable families from the threat of hunger today and tomorrow.  Let me suggest three lines of effort:First, we G20 countries must set the example and call on others to avoid counterproductive policy responses such as export restrictions and stockpiling, which distort markets and further drive-up prices.  Equally, governments should tailor fiscal responses to those most in need, leveraging digital tools where possible to carefully target support for vulnerable households rather than employing blanket subsidies that are regressive and costly. Second, we must leverage the existing food security and agriculture architecture to the maximum.  The multilateral development banks (MDBs), the Rome-based food agencies (including IFAD), the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP), the IMF, and the WTO all have roles to play.For example, I met with the heads of the International Financial Institutions on this important issue, and they responded in May with the IFI Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity.  We must continue to encourage these institutions to step up and surge their response to the crisis with urgency and to implement their commitments as outlined in the Action Plan.  I was also pleased with the strong outcomes on food security at the WTO’s 12 Ministerial Conference.  Thank you, Ngozi.We don’t need new institutions.  We need robust coordination, knowledge sharing, research and development, financing, and action.  In this respect, the Global Alliance for Food Security is helpful.And I further propose that G20 deputies consider how to enhance cooperation between G20 finance ministries and the relevant other authorities, including by improving data transparency.Third, G20 countries must take steps to provide financial assistance.  For our part, the U.S. announced last month that we are committing a further $2.76 billion to tackling food insecurity, on top of $2.8 billion already provided since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.  We are also providing $500 million for the EBRD’s Resilience and Livelihood Framework to support food and energy security and $155 million to GAFSP.  We will also be contributing to the African Development Bank’s African Emergency Food Production Facility and IFAD’s Crisis Response Initiative.Much more work remains to eliminate hunger and poverty beyond responding to the current crisis.  I look forward to continuing our engagement with partners in the G20, International Financial Institutions, and other International Organizations."
282,,"July 15, 2022","Thank you, Minister Sri Mulyani, and thanks to your team for the tireless work you’ve undertaken to host the G20 in a year where we are facing an extremely challenging environment. Just as the recovery from COVID-19 was taking hold, Russia’s unjustified war against Ukraine sent a shockwave through the global economy.  Indeed, the fallout from this shockwave is an overarching focus of our discussions in Bali.  Russia’s war has propagated a commodity price shock as prices of food, fertilizer, and energy remain high, resulting in more people going hungry.  This shock has required us to take action to help mitigate food insecurity, including through our call-to-action for International Financial Institutions to redouble their work, and through our leading role with the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program – to which the United States is donating an additional $155 million.  The economic impact of the war is further exacerbating inflation, harming government fiscal positions, and exacerbating volatility in capital flows while many countries are still recovering from COVID-19.  Accordingly, we all have to revisit our approach to macroeconomic policy.  Like many of you here today, I’m no stranger to macroeconomic policy making, having spent three decades in various policy roles.  Over this period, the global economy has faced many challenges – including balance of payments crises, debt crises, financial crises, and a global pandemic. In my remarks today, I will share reflections and three lessons learned from my experience.  I will also reflect on the challenges policymakers, particularly those in emerging and developing countries, face from external shocks.  And I will share my view that, as we look ahead, the IMF’s Integrated Policy Framework – or IPF – is a step forward in our understanding and consideration of a broader range of macroeconomic policy tools. What are some lessons we’ve learned?  First, it is critical to establish, maintain, and update a playbook of policy responses that aims to minimize the duration and severity of recessions and mitigate adverse economic consequences on firms and individuals.  In both the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries implemented large fiscal responses, serving both the “macro” objective of reducing the severity of the shocks economy-wide, along with the “micro” objective of supporting the individuals, families, and firms most impacted by these crises.  During the global financial crisis, many advanced economies pushed monetary policy into new territory, adopting negative policy rates and implementing quantitative easing.  Targeted liquidity support was provided to certain asset markets that began to seize up.  A similar monetary response occurred around the world during the pandemic, with more emerging market economies aggressively cutting rates than was the case after previous global shocks. These macroeconomic policies served as the “first responders” to the economic fallout of the pandemic, and the lessons learned from past shocks enabled us to respond quickly and aggressively.  The impact on the global economy was severe, but less severe than it otherwise would have been.  In June 2020, the IMF projected a 5 percent contraction in global economic activity for that year, but the actual decline was just over 3 percent.  I feel confident that the global macroeconomic response played a role in lessening the size of the contraction. A second lesson is that sound fundamentals, strong institutions, and policy credibility underpinned by clear communication remain important foundations for any policy mix.  Fiscal responses are only as effective as their implementation.  The public sector must be able to efficiently raise funds and deliver them to the targeted recipients.  Institutional transparency is also important for reducing corruption in both the revenue and expenditure sides of fiscal policy.  Monetary policy effectiveness relies on the credibility of the central bank.  As the United States learned in the 1980s if inflation expectations become de-anchored, lowering inflation is far more difficult and costly to the economy.  Liquidity support is also more effective where markets are sufficiently developed to respond to it.  For some of the United States’ liquidity facilities, the announcement effect was enough to calm markets and restore their functioning.   Third, even with sound fundamentals and strong institutions, financial flows can be volatile. The flow of capital benefits source and recipient economies alike through a more efficient global allocation of resources and by allowing countries to smooth consumption.  Foreign capital can increase productivity and wages, transfer know-how, raise GDP growth, and increase the supply of credit.  Yet, countries experiencing large capital flow surges or sharp swings can experience greater macroeconomic volatility and are vulnerable to crises.  Strong domestic policy frameworks can help attract flows that are less volatile or less sensitive to external shocks, such as local currency debt flows and direct investment. Macroprudential measures can help achieve more stable cross-border lending and attenuate financial cycles that undermine overall financial stability.  But, while robust macroeconomic and financial sector policies can help manage these risks, they cannot eliminate them.This is particularly relevant for emerging markets in the context of the current global economic environment.  Financial conditions have tightened due to rising, broad based inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainty brought on by Russia’s war against Ukraine, and a slowdown in global growth.  Now, portfolio investment is beginning to flow out of emerging markets.  Maintaining or bolstering policy frameworks and institutional credibility remains an essential backstop for managing the risks of volatile capital flows.Countries are responding to these developments from different starting positions.  This underscores the clear need for policy makers to understand what course of action is most effective and what is appropriate, taking these three lessons learned into account.  Furthermore, factors like external borrowing constraints, export price stickiness, shallow markets, and other economic characteristics matter for how effective policies can be, particularly in the short-term.  The field of economics has made great strides in understanding open economies, global capital flows, and the role of policies.  From Mundell-Fleming through to the work under the IMF’s new Integrated Policy Framework, we have broadened our knowledge of the complexities of the international financial system.  These advances help refine our understanding of how policies interact and can respond jointly in the face of pandemics, financial crises, and other local and global shocks.The IPF recognizes that country-specific characteristics can lead to externalities in economic decisions, and that it can be beneficial to add to the playbook a wider set of policy tools to optimally meet domestic objectives.   Emerging markets and low-income countries may, in some circumstances, benefit from capital flow management, and foreign exchange intervention alongside monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential policies.  However, a remaining key challenge is to identify in real time when these circumstances arise or when, instead, more structural policies should be prioritized.  We now better understand the case in support of using exchange rate and capital flow management policies.  But that does not mean we have forgotten the case against them.  For example, it remains important that foreign exchange intervention not be used to create an unfair competitive advantage or delay needed balance of payments adjustments.  With its core mandate to maintain the stability of the international monetary system and the surveillance of exchange rate policies, the IMF has a clear role in ensuring these countries apply complementary policy tools responsibly.  Country-specific circumstances help shine a light on the proper underlying macroeconomic policies and the appropriate complementary policy tools.  But clear guidance on when these policies are not appropriate remains equally important.  As is the case for all the tools we use as policymakers, these new frameworks should provide a strong basis for consistent advice as we face what comes next. "
283,,"July 12, 2022","TOKYO — Ahead of the G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors Meeting in Bali, Indonesia, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen and Japan Finance Minister and Minister of State for Financial Services Suzuki Shunichi held an in-person bilateral meeting in Tokyo. Following the meeting, they issued the following joint-statement agreeing to further strengthen the U.S. and Japan's bilateral ties and affirming the pivotal roles played by both countries in tackling the difficult challenges facing the global community:We renew our strong commitment to address challenges facing the global and domestic economies, including higher food, energy and commodity prices and growing food insecurity, compounded by Russia´s war of aggression against Ukraine. We call on the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) to implement the commitments in their Action Plan to Address Food Insecurity. We will provide well-targeted support and build a more resilient and stronger supply chain in close collaboration with like-minded countries and international organizations. The economic fallout from Russia’s invasion has raised exchange rate volatility, which can have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We will continue to consult closely on exchange markets and cooperate as appropriate on currency issues, in line with our G7 and G20 commitments.We remain steadfast in our solidarity with Ukraine and continue to support Ukraine. We are united in our strong condemnation of Russia’s unprovoked, unjustifiable, and illegal war against Ukraine and continue to increase Russia’s cost of its war by implementing economic and financial sanctions. We welcome G7 efforts to continue exploring ways to curb rising energy prices, including the feasibility of price caps where appropriate, while considering mitigation mechanisms to ensure that most vulnerable and impacted countries maintain access to energy markets. We will work with the international community to coordinate and maximize the efficiency and impacts of bilateral and multilateral supports to address Ukraine’s critical near-term economic challenges and safeguard macroeconomic stability, and we are committed to supporting Ukraine in rebuilding for its future, based on a clear blueprint to be developed with the assistance of the IFIs.On global health, we welcome the establishment of a Financial Intermediary Fund (FIF) at the World Bank as a new global financing mechanism dedicated to addressing financing gaps in pandemic prevention, preparedness and response (PPR). The FIF will complement the work of existing institutions and catalyze funding from domestic, private, philanthropic, and bilateral sources. We underscore the need for the FIF to launch and become operational by September of this year. We also highly value the meaningful, ongoing collaboration between Finance and Health Ministers as well as through the G20 Joint Finance-Health Task Force. We commit to further strengthening this coordination and building a resilient global health architecture, including through accelerating progress towards achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC).On climate change, we reaffirm our commitment to achieve economy-wide net zero emissions by 2050. We will promote a just transition that keeps the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5℃ within reach through inclusive international cooperation that includes all the major emitters. We will focus on reducing carbon intensity through the full range of climate mitigation measures appropriately tailored to each country’s emissions profile and context. We share our intent to continue to lead in developing a Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) for Indonesia.As for debt issues, we underscore the importance of swiftly delivering successful country cases with increased predictability for those who have requested a debt treatment under the G20 Common Framework. We urge all relevant creditors, including non-Paris Club countries, such as China, with large outstanding claims on low-income countries facing debt sustainability challenges, to contribute constructively to necessary debt treatments.  We emphasize the critical role of creditor coordination to ensure fair burden sharing among all creditors in a debt treatment for vulnerable middle-income countries, notably Sri Lanka.   We also urge all official bilateral creditors to share lending data with the World Bank and IMF to secure accurate data through creditor-borrower debt data reconciliation.On infrastructure, we reaffirm the importance of promoting high-quality, transparent, and sustainable infrastructure investments to narrow the infrastructure gaps in Asia-Pacific and other regions. To ensure the quality and value of our investments, we will deliver projects based on the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investments (QII) and encourage the use of QII principles by our partners. We will continue to work bilaterally, multilaterally with G7 partners under the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, and with like-minded partners.On international taxation, we reaffirm our firm commitment to the timely and effective implementation of the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework two-pillar solution. We welcome the progress made on the technical detail of Pillar 1 and are committed to work towards its adoption following the revised timeline agreed by the Inclusive Framework.  We will continue to work toward the swift implementation of Pillar 2 and expect the Inclusive Framework to swiftly finalize the implementation framework.We extend strong support for the review of G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance, and affirm the role of sound corporate governance frameworks in contributing to the economic recovery in the post COVID-19 era.At this critical juncture in history, Japan and the United States, as the world’s two largest democratic economies, resolve to promote strong, resilient, and sustainable economic growth, and to strengthen the rules-based global economic order."
284,,"July 12, 2022","I have arrived at a time of deep sadness over the killing of former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo. He was a deeply impactful leader who leaves behind a legacy of significant achievement helping Japan revitalize its economy and leadership position in the world. His influence will be felt in Japan for many years. I offer my sincerest condolences to Prime Minister Abe’s family and the nation of Japan as it mourns his passing.I am here today to help carry on the spirit of one of Prime Minister Abe’s strongest legacies, and that is maintaining the close partnership between the U.S. and Japan.You and I see each other on the margins of multilateral meetings, but I am glad now to visit you, in Tokyo, for in depth discussions of our shared priorities.Our governments have common viewpoints and interests on many of the most pressing priorities affecting our national interests, as well as global stability and prosperity. When we work together, we are each more effective.I look forward to discussing urgent issues with you, including the continued importance of manufacturing and supply chains with key trading partners like Japan.Making our supply chains more resilient – through what I call friend-shoring – will help protect us against costly disruptions that lead to higher prices, as well as other supply chain bottlenecks that adversely impact our consumers, workers, and businesses. Right now, countries around the world are experiencing that acutely because of Russia’s war in Ukraine and the ongoing effects of the pandemic.Of course, we will also discuss how the United States and Japan can continue our united efforts to end Russia’s brutal war against Ukraine. Together, our joint actions along with other allies have resulted in Russia’s economy losing 15 years of gains in a single year, and their armaments industry deeply impacted, which weakens their military capabilities.I look forward to building on that work with discussions today to follow up on the direction by the G7 Leaders to explore a price cap that will further deny Putin revenue to fund his military, while also helping address the impact of high energy prices that the world is experiencing right now because of Russia’s war.On the topic of energy, I am glad that we are co-leading the Just Energy Transition Partnership in Indonesia. These partnerships are ambitious and innovative ways to support high-emitting emerging market countries that have strong political commitment to accelerate their transition away from carbon-intensive energy sources, particularly coal, and towards renewables in a just manner for impact communities, based on partner countries’ ownership.We are also committed to leading global efforts to buttress against the threat of food insecurity, both in the very short-term, and in addressing vulnerabilities in food systems over the longer-term. Finally, we are committed to promoting a global system of fair competition and orderly resolution of sovereign debt distress.The close friendship between the United States and Japan also underpins our cooperation on productive bilateral and global agendas, as we work toward building the economy of the next generation."

286,,"July 4, 2022","It is a tremendous privilege for me to share this day with you. For all of you here, today is the culmination of a long road – a road that for many of you began decades ago. The 52 of you journeyed from 42 different countries to America. Even though it was not always easy, you made your life in this country – one step at a time. Along the way, you have already enriched our nation. Several of you have even served in our Armed Forces, honorably protecting our nation before becoming a citizen. Whether you were born in Ukraine or El Salvador, Iran or Iraq, South Africa or South Korea, you have now completed a process that may be difficult but is fundamentally American. As each of you know better than most, the American story is the immigrant story. Immigration is not only consistent with our values. In America, it is who we are. 45 million immigrants live in the United States today, which means that more than one in eight of us were born elsewhere. Your decision to come to America and pursue a life here has made our country better. It’s not just that you make our culture richer or our neighborhoods more vibrant. You make our economy stronger as well. Immigration is essential to building a strong labor force, generating new innovations, and growing our economy.For decades, immigrants have been a key contributor to our economic output and productivity.  For instance, from 2010 to 2018, foreign-born workers accounted for nearly 60% of growth in the U.S. labor force.  Immigrants strengthen our workforce, and, in the process, help drive the resiliency and vitality of our economy. At Treasury, we are working to make sure all Americans – including immigrants – have every tool at their disposal to succeed. We’ve done this by supporting low-income and working-class people throughout the pandemic, injecting additional capital into small businesses, and investing in communities to ensure that the pandemic did not lead to long-term economic scarring. Our goal is to build an America that many of you came here for: one of opportunity and possibility.These are Treasury and Biden Administration policies, but they are also personal to me. My father’s family immigrated to America from Eastern Poland, and my mother’s family from Germany. If they had not made the brave decision to come to a new country, I would not be standing here today. A few generations ago, members of my family likely took the same oath you just did. In fact, the oath you took is strikingly similar to the oath I took as Treasury Secretary. And it’s quite close to the one each President repeats at their inauguration, as well as the one those of you who joined our Armed Forces recited upon enlisting. This is the genius of the Constitution that you and I have both now sworn to support and defend: it strives to be the ultimate equalizer. No matter your occupation or how long you have been in the United States, we bear the same privileges and responsibilities of our most important title: citizen. You all know well the duties that come with citizenship: to vote, to get involved in your community, to listen to the voices of others, and to work towards a better America. So congratulations again, my fellow Americans. I am honored to have been able to mark this milestone with you, and I look forward to your continued contributions to our country. "

290,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
293,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1. For additional analysis on Treasury market liquidity conditions, see (for example): “Resilience redux in the Treasury Market” by Darrell Duffie (August 25, 2023) and “How Has Treasury Market Liquidity Evolved in 2023” by Michael Fleming (October 17, 2023).2. Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

294,,"June 28, 2022","WASHINGTON - The G7 leaders’ pursuit of a limit on the price of Russian oil represents a significant step in advancing our twin goals of sharply reducing Russian revenue and stabilizing global energy prices. Following the leaders’ direction today, the Treasury Department will work expeditiously with our counterparts in G7 countries, and other global allies and partners, to advance this effort. Our united response to Putin’s war of aggression has already imposed historic costs on Russia’s economy and has made it harder for it to wage war against Ukraine. By working together to limit the price of Russian oil, we will further strengthen the existing sanctions imposed by the G-7 and our partners to make sure that Putin will not be able to profit from the higher global energy costs that have resulted from his invasion.It is the top economic priority of the Biden Administration to lower energy prices for American business and consumers – and energy prices are a primary driver of today’s inflation. Limiting the cost of Russian oil will put downward pressure on global energy prices in a way that dampens the impact of Putin’s war on the U.S. economy.

295,,"June 21, 2022","It’s great to be here. This is my first visit to Indian Country, and it’s meaningful to me to see first-hand the beauty of the Rosebud Reservation and to hear about your Tribe’s rich heritage.  It’s also been illuminating to listen to you discuss the deep challenges that you and Tribal nations around the country face, and hear your thoughts on how we can partner together to accelerate the economic recovery for all Tribal citizens.I’ve spent my entire career thinking about economic policy and how it can help people during hard times and create longer-term opportunities.  I see a great deal that policies can do to support Tribal communities.  Tribes are the backbone of local communities, and Tribal governments are often the largest employer of their citizens and residents in surrounding areas.  Simply put, reservations can be centers of economic opportunity for millions of Tribal and non-Tribal members and they merit deep investment by the federal government and our private sector partners.Yet, despite the efforts by Tribal governments to develop their economies, significant inequities exist.  Many have their roots in prior federal policy.  According to the US Commission for Civil Rights’ Broken Promises Report, over 25 percent of Native Americans live in poverty.  In certain Tribes, over half of their citizens live in poverty.  For Native Americans living on reservations, the unemployment rate is around 50 percent. Those numbers are unacceptably high.The last two years have been hard for everyone, but they’ve been especially difficult for Native American communities.  Tribal communities have had some of the highest COVID mortality rates in the country, and the data shows that few suffered more than Native American workers and enterprises during the pandemic.  In addition to the pain the pandemic caused Tribal families and communities, this disproportionate impact resulted in the loss of critical Tribal revenue that supports governmental services for Tribal citizens in need.The American Rescue Plan, signed by President Biden in March 2021, provided much-needed relief, injecting billions of dollars into Tribal communities across the country.  This legislation has led to a historic investment in Indian Country.  Our flagship program, the Fiscal Recovery Funds, provided $20 billion to Tribal governments to help fight the pandemic and help Tribal households and businesses recover.  Tribes across the country, including right here, used these funds for vaccination efforts to protect their Tribal citizens.  Some places – like Rosebud – are using the funds for affordable housing projects.  Others, such as the Quechan Indian Tribe, are providing assistance to Tribal members who own small businesses that have been negatively affected by COVID‐19.  To date, 99% of this fund has been distributed, benefitting 2.6 million Tribal citizens across the U.S.Other programs have also helped Tribal nations recover.  Take the Emergency Rental Assistance program.  Tribal citizens faced acute rental challenges pre-pandemic, and these conditions rapidly worsened after March 2020. This program allocated $800 million to Tribes to help prevent evictions and keep Tribal citizens safely and stably housed.  Early reports show that thousands of low-income Tribal citizens have received housing assistance across Tribal nations.  Here, Rosebud has spent $6.3 million to serve 700 low-income households in need of emergency rental assistance.But the ARP was an important milestone not only due to the relief it provided; it also began to expand and redefine the relationship of the Treasury Department with Tribal nations.  At Treasury, we took seriously the charge to use this moment as an opportunity to establish deeper engagement and trust with Tribal communities across the country.  As Treasury distributed this aid, which in totality is over $30 billion in direct aid to Tribal governments, we made sure to do so in a way that both respected Tribal sovereignty and built upon our partnership to tackle Indian Country’s economic challenges. We have strengthened our government-to-government relationship with Tribal nations.  Over the past year and a half, our Department has held 15 Tribal consultations and over 100 engagement sessions with Tribal leaders, along with one-on-one outreach to Tribes directly and through related organizations.  These consultations serve to strengthen our engagement with Tribal national and regional associations and solidify our interagency partnerships.  We’ve worked together with the White House to better coordinate the delivery of support to Tribal nations.At Treasury, we integrated Tribal leader feedback into our implementation and distribution of funds.  We saw that Tribes faced unprecedented fiscal challenges because of the pandemic at the same time they took on new responsibilities to keep their citizens healthy and afloat.  So, we designed the Fiscal Recovery Funds to be able to meet the needs of each individual tribe.  We utilized Tribal self-certified data in allocation methodologies, incorporated Tribal flexibilities into guidance, and customized Tribal government reporting.  Our administration of this aid has shown that learning from and partnering with Tribal nations results in better federal policy for Tribal and surrounding communities. We were able to meet the different needs of different Tribes.  For instance, when you here in Rosebud told us that “many of [your] tribal members cannot afford internet in the home,” which “resulted in many children unable to attend virtual school as well as tribal employees unable to connect remotely,” we worked with you to approve a Capital Projects Funding Award to enhance internet connectivity across the Tribe.  To date, Treasury has made $8 million in Tribal Capital Projects Awards.  This is just one way Treasury is working with the rest of the Biden-Harris Administration to improve broadband connectivity across Indian Country.Our progress over the past year and a half was only possible because of a decision we made at the beginning of this administration:  to make sure that Tribal communities have a strong voice inside the Treasury building.  As we established the Office of Recovery Programs last year, we built in a dedicated Tribal policy and engagement team within the office, charged with informing our Tribal policy and engagement efforts across recovery programs.Crucially, this team was staffed with diverse Tribal citizens with previous Tribal government, policy, and economic development experience.  And it’s on them that I want to end my remarks.  Earlier today President Biden announced his intent to appoint Chief Lynn Malerba of the Mohegan Tribe as our next Treasurer.  For the first time in history, a Native woman’s name will be the signature on our currency.With this announcement, we are making an even deeper commitment to Indian Country:  The Treasury Department is establishing an Office of Tribal and Native Affairs, in the Office of the Treasurer, which will be responsible for Treasury-wide Tribal work. Treasurer Malerba will expand our unique relationship with Tribal nations, continuing our joint efforts to support the development of Tribal economies and economic opportunities for Tribal citizens.  Importantly, we look forward to working with Tribal nations and Congress to make this office permanent – so it will be there for decades to come.I promised to visit Indian Country, and I couldn’t be more gratified to have had this chance to visit with you today.  Treasury and the Administration are deeply committed to partnering with you.  We know that the programs the government is now implementing are by no means sufficient to remedy centuries-long inequities and injustices.  But they’re a start, and it’s a start that I think we can build upon in the years to come.  I’m excited to continue this journey – with you – as even deeper partners.  Thank you very much."
296,,"May 17, 2022","Thank you for inviting me to speak at the Brussels Economic Forum.  I am honored to be giving the Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa lecture.  

It is fitting that our discussions today focus on building the economy of the next generation, given the uncertainty about the future of the global economy inherent in the present geopolitical context.  Indeed, young people in Europe and the United States have a huge stake in this discussion as they consider how we will end the COVID-19 pandemic, protect the planet they will inhabit, and ensure the peace and stability of daily life that so many take for granted.  Let alone whether they will be able to secure well-paying jobs to support themselves and eventually their families.

While so much is uncertain, one thing we have in our power is the ability to deliver real and effective cooperation to secure a more prosperous and sustainable world for the next generation on both sides of the Atlantic.  The United States and Europe have shown what we can do when we come together.  Our response in confronting the immediate crisis we face today—ending Vladimir Putin’s brutal war against Ukraine and its people—is a clear demonstration. 

But we can go further.  We can extend this potent transatlantic cooperation to address many of the other shared challenges we face.  

Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa was a person who thought big.  Of course, he is best remembered for his commitment to an integrated Europe and his seminal contributions to central banking and the creation of the euro.  His life’s work was based on an optimism about what could be achieved through probing technical analysis and informed collaboration.  At the same time, he was not shy about pointing out what he saw as weaknesses or shortfalls with the approaches of the day—shortfalls that if left unaddressed would undermine a more prosperous and secure Europe, and indeed a secure world.  

As we look to the future, we should take this inspiration from Tommaso’s legacy—be open to challenge, improve, and where necessary, replace existing approaches as we consider how to respond to the questions before us today.   

I want to start by highlighting areas where the United States and Europe are already strong partners:  areas where we have more to do, but where our cooperation is already producing promising results.  

The most tangible example is our joint response to Vladimir Putin’s unprovoked war against Ukraine and its people.  The war is taking a devastating human toll—with lives tragically lost, families internally displaced or becoming refugees, and communities and cities destroyed.  

We have taken a strong and united stand against Russia’s heinous actions.  And thanks to our unity, we have seen that swift and sweeping sanctions can have enormous force.  The United States, Europe, and our partners—representing well over half the world’s economy—have imposed an unprecedented suite of financial sanctions and export controls on Russia.  This multilateral approach has enabled us to impose significant costs and limits on Russia, which I believe are degrading its ability to prosecute this war and project power in the years ahead.

By acting together, we demonstrate that these sanctions are not motivated by any one country’s foreign policy or economic objectives.  Rather, we are acting to uphold principles—our opposition to aggression, to widespread violence against civilians, and in alignment with our commitment to a rules-based global order that protects peace and prosperity.  And by standing together, we ensure that Russia cannot play off some of us against others.

Rest assured, if Putin continues his heinous war of choice, the Biden Administration will work with you and our other partners to push Russia further towards economic, financial, and strategic isolation.  More and more, the Kremlin will be forced to choose between propping up its economy and funding the continuation of Putin’s brutal war. 

Now we need to extend our cooperation to boosting support for Ukraine.  Ukraine’s immediate financing needs are significant.  Due to the ingenuity and bravery of Ukrainian officials, their government continues to function.  But in the months until tax collection can resume at pace, Ukraine needs budget funding to pay soldiers, employees, and pensioners, as well as to operate an economy that meets its citizens basic needs.  In short order, it will need to turn to repairing and restoring critical utilities and services.  Eventually, Ukraine will need massive support and private investment for reconstruction and recovery, akin to the task of rebuilding in Europe after 1945.  Ukraine will have to take this one step at a time, but we can help today and acknowledge and prepare for what is coming.  What’s clear is that the bilateral and multilateral support announced so far will not be sufficient to address Ukraine’s needs, even in the short term.

That’s why President Biden has called on the U.S. Congress to provide an additional $33 billion in security, economic, and humanitarian aid.  I sincerely ask all our partners to join us in increasing their financial support to Ukraine.  Our joint efforts are critical to help ensure Ukraine’s democracy prevails over Putin’s aggression.

Another recent example of transatlantic cooperation is the international tax deal.  This past October, 137 countries, including all the EU Member States and the United States, came together to support a historic deal that will reshape the international tax system.

This agreement simply could not have happened without close coordination between the United States and Europe.  Through intense engagement, we listened to one another regarding our respective interests and challenges, and were able to come to an agreement.  We also brought in the rest of the world, including developing and emerging economies, so that the agreement met all countries’ needs.

Pillar 2 of this deal establishes a minimum effective global corporate tax rate.  Countries have agreed to tax the foreign earnings of their multinational corporations at a rate of at least 15 percent and to do so on a country-by-country basis.  This agreement will halt a decades-long race to the bottom in corporate taxation around the globe—a competition that has proven self-defeating.   

Once implemented, we can put the revenues produced by this deal toward funding investments to make our economies more sustainable and fairer—not just in the United States and the EU, but also in emerging and developing countries.  And by moving together we will raise these revenues in a way that levels the playing field.  Businesses will be able to compete on economic fundamentals, rather than on tax incentives, thereby contributing to our collective prosperity.

Pillar 1 of this deal, focused on the taxation of digital services, puts an end to trade tensions between the EU and the United States that threaten our companies with multiple layers of taxation and our consumers with rising costs from tariffs.  That dynamic isn’t good for anyone.

Pillar 1 will also update and stabilize the international tax architecture, providing a fairer allocation of revenues than the status quo and tax certainty that is good for business and investment.  Rather than facing harmful unilateral measures, companies will be able to plan and thus invest their capital efficiently.

We cannot rest on our laurels.  We still have important work to do to get international tax reform across the finish line.  We must resolve the open issues in Pillar 1 so that the multilateral treaty can be ready for signature.  And on Pillar 2, the EU and the United States must show leadership by expeditiously implementing the global minimum tax in our domestic laws. 

Our sanctions against Russia and the international tax deal are tangible recent examples of what we can achieve when we work together.  These experiences can serve as inspiration as we consider the breadth of unmet challenges that would also benefit from such ambitious cooperation.  

First, we must address the present energy security emergency to ensure supply for Europe and the world, while using this as our moment to rapidly accelerate the transition to clean energy.

We know that tackling climate change is becoming more urgent.  The recent IPCC reports confirm that our window of opportunity to leave a livable planet to future generations is even closer to being permanently shut.  

At the same time, Russia’s war against Ukraine is having immediate impacts on the availability of oil and gas, which continue to account for four-fifths of global energy production used to power economies today.  

I know that Europe is facing a uniquely difficult situation, given existing infrastructure and supply contracts with Russia over the near term.  That is why I commend European leaders for their proposal to phase out all Russian energy supplies within six months.  And I recognize the solidarity of the European people in accepting the implications of this proposal.

Russia’s war and its recent decision to cut gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, threatening other countries with the same, show that it is not a trusted partner.  Russia is using energy as a weapon to deploy against those who stand against its aggression.  The United States is committed to working with Europe in your efforts to meet your energy needs, while also breaking dependence on Russian energy.  This includes working with other partners to increase export volumes of LNG to Europe.

As we do so, we must heed this wake-up call to expedite the global transition to a more secure and cleaner energy future.  No country controls the wind and the sun.  Let’s make sure that this is the last time that the global economy is held hostage to the hostile actions of those who produce fossil fuels.  This will happen again if we don’t change our approach.  

In the near term, we will likely see an uptick in coal and other fossil fuel usage as countries seek to keep legacy assets online longer.  And if this blunts some of our immediate climate goals for a short period, let it also prod us to redouble our efforts on clean and renewable energy.

We know that the key to sustainable energy security lies in the development and deployment of renewable and zero emissions energy.  Remember that renewables already account for over 80 percent of new electricity generating capacity year globally.  Why?  Because they are often cheaper and less subject to price spikes and external market volatility.  

Over the medium term, we need to dramatically ramp up renewables, invest in new technologies, and increase support for energy efficiency measures to reduce energy demand.  Depending on how long higher energy prices last, we should see some natural supply responses and new technologies deployed.  The longer the current disruption lasts—the more aggressively we say no to Russian oil—the more remunerative it will naturally become to switch to renewables. 

Second, we must modernize the approaches we have used to build trade integration both to better incorporate our shared core values and principles and to provide economic security.

We have become too vulnerable to countries using their market positions in raw materials, technologies, or products to exercise geopolitical leverage or disrupt markets for their own gain.  For example, the development of dependence on Russian oil favored cost and convenience over concentration risk and considerations of security.

And energy is not the only example of trading off cost against security.  Russia is also a large supplier of key minerals.  And we have long accepted a significant dependence on China for the supply of rare earths.  These minerals and materials comprise vital inputs in aviation, vehicle production, battery manufacture, renewable energy systems, and technology manufacturing.  China is responsible for 60 percent of rare earth mining and nearly 40 percent of reserves, giving the country geostrategic leverage.  While many of these materials are abundant in the earth, they are costly and, in some instances, polluting to extract.  

In addition, China is building a consequential market share in certain technology products and seeks a dominant position in the manufacture and use of semiconductors.  And China has employed a variety of unfair trade practices in its efforts to achieve this position.

We have a set of common vulnerabilities that we should address.

Another rather different but relevant example is solar panels—where our concern is not security but rather the clash between our human rights values and the cost advantage of buying these products at a time when we are eager to achieve decarbonization.

My point is to suggest that we should consider ways to maintain free trade and at the same time lessen some of these risks.  We do not want a retreat from trade integration, causing us to forego the benefits it brings to the world.  But as the economist Richard Baldwin said: “Putting all your production eggs in one basket doesn’t make sense, no matter where the basket is.”  The recent crises have shown us that, in most cases, it is more secure to have multiple sourcing that is not fully correlated.  

What I am proposing is that we properly account for the externalities stemming from these other considerations—concentration, geopolitical concerns, security risks, and values.  In the case of rare earths, numerous other countries possess these resources.  It is in our collective interest for them to pursue greater extraction with care for environmental and other consequences.  With high-tech manufactured products, it may make sense to create incentives for multiple supply chain alternatives to arise—with smaller market shares and with more trusted countries.

I believe that we need to consider how to incentivize the “friend-shoring” of supply chains to a greater number of trusted countries for a variety of products, so we can continue to securely extend market access, with lower risks to our economy, as well as to those of our trade partners.

Third, we must improve the global health architecture to enhance our resilience to future pandemics.  The COVID-19 pandemic has cost us millions of lives, trillions of dollars in lost economic output, and severely impacted health systems around the world.  It has also revealed how unprepared we were at the national, regional, and global levels to address health threats that know no boundaries.  So even as we work to overcome COVID-19, we must strengthen our collective efforts to prevent the next pandemic, and be ready with detection, data sharing and treatment strategies.

Efforts to tackle the pandemic, including through the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, provide some useful lessons for strengthening collaboration.  G20 countries are also working with a range of international partners through a Joint Health and Finance Task Force to strengthen cooperation across the health and finance communities to address the current gaps in the international health architecture.  This includes closing the estimated $10 billion per year shortfall in investments in pandemic preparedness.  Several countries have agreed to support a Financial Intermediary Fund as a flexible mechanism to help fill the gaps in health system investments at the country, regional, and global level.  We look forward to strong European support in launching this funding mechanism this year. 

And finally, we need to revisit our approach to development financing to meet the vast unmet needs and better respond to more global challenges.  We are already working together to address the spillovers of Russia’s war against Ukraine, while many developing countries are still grappling with strained policy space and output losses from COVID-19.  Our cooperation—alongside the G20 and many other partners around the world—has included unprecedented funding levels, novel debt relief initiatives, and a heightened focus on addressing longstanding food security challenges.  

We must also think beyond the immediate development priorities.  As many as 10 billion people are yet to be born in this century.  The reality is that most of these people will be born outside of the United States and Europe.  

The last couple of centuries have featured the “rise of the West.”  It’s clear that the promise of the next several generations will include other geographies.  Fulfilling that promise will require significant investments—in areas such as education, healthcare, and sustainable infrastructure.  We have also seen that our current models for funding global public goods, like climate adaptation and mitigation, healthy security, and fragility, are insufficient.  To finance these immense needs, we need to look beyond our current models, as official development finance, helpful as it may be, will never be sufficient.  The question is how to tap the much deeper pools of private capital to mobilize the trillions needed to deliver on the aspirations of the next generation.   

We should take bold action because of the moral imperative to eliminate poverty and provide opportunities for young people around the world.  And of course, a more prosperous global economy will also have direct benefits for Americans and Europeans, fueling growth and jobs at home, as well as greater peace and security.  

There is a strong case for pursuing common goals jointly, not unilaterally.  For example, we have a common interest in incentivizing China to refrain from economic practices that have disadvantaged us all.  These practices range from those affecting trade and investment, to development and climate policies, to approaches to provide debt relief to countries facing unsustainable debt burdens.  Where we share common interests, we should all find ways to engage with China and express our views.  China is more likely to respond favorably if it cannot play one of us off against another.  The Biden Administration believes that cooperation of this kind will be more effective than the unilateralism that we saw in the not too distant past.  

We should all aspire to encouraging China to drop objectionable practices.  If we can do so, we will stand a better chance of competing with China on a level playing field, which will benefit our businesses and consumers.  And we will have a stronger basis for convincing China to join us in the many important areas where truly global cooperation is necessary.

To conclude, let me turn back to Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa.  Despite all he accomplished—with his vision for a more integrated Europe realized—Tommaso never stopped pressing for greater cooperation to address shortcomings and strengthen our global system.  Indeed, one of his last speeches notably called for renewed cooperation to remedy the global financial crisis and build an international monetary system that would prevent its recurrence.

We have before us now an immense array of challenges. So, let’s think big, and let’s do it together.  We must redouble our efforts to create opportunity, a sustainable environment, and ultimately widespread and sustainable prosperity now and for our children’s children.  "
297,,"May 16, 2022","WARSAW, POLAND – Today, Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen visited the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews on the site of the former Warsaw Ghetto. The Museum showcases the important history of Jews in Poland over the past thousand years and stands directly across from the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes, which commemorates the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Secretary Yellen delivered remarks and laid a wreath at the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes.Thank you for being here with me today. I’m honored to be at this important site. This museum not only bears witness to one of humanity’s darkest chapters but also celebrates hundreds of years of vibrant Polish Jewish culture.Being here today is personal to me. My father’s family immigrated to the United States from Sokołów Podlaski, just over 50 miles from where we stand now.The town to which I trace my roots has a tragic yet familiar history. During the Holocaust, nearly the entire Jewish population, including much of my family, was deported or murdered. The Nazis destroyed the town’s cultural landmarks, and the Jewish cemetery was vandalized. Today, Sokołów Podlaski’s Jewish community is a fraction of what it once was.Yet, the region where my relatives lived was also home to resistance. Eastern Poland was a hub for groups like the Polish resistance movement, a brave opposition who – in the face of insurmountable odds and almost unthinkable risk – stood up to evil. As this museum reminds us, the story of the Jews in Poland is not just one of tragedy; it is a story of bravery and perseverance.That is part of the legacy I am here today to honor: taking action to confront evil. And it is a legacy that is also at the core of the Treasury Department.In the spring of 1940, a time when the United States still held an official position of neutrality in World War II, Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau persuaded President Roosevelt to sign an Executive Order freezing the assets of Denmark and Norway. The Order made it impossible for the Nazis to capture overseas assets of countries that they were invading. With this, Morgenthau launched what he called the “unseen front” of the war, a critical but largely unrecognized set of economic actions that damaged the Nazis’ ability to fund their encroachment into other nations.And, in the face of resistance from other arms of government, Morgenthau also convinced Roosevelt to establish the War Refugee Board. The Board worked to rescue Jews from occupied territories and provide relief to those in hiding and in concentration camps, ultimately saving tens of thousands of lives.The lesson of Morgenthau’s decisive actions is the lesson of Sokołów Podlaski and the lesson of many exhibits in this museum: We must use the tools at our disposal to fight oppression. And that lesson must be applied today.A few hundred miles to our East lies another place where people are bravely fighting for their freedom. My thoughts continue to be with the people of Ukraine as they fight back against Putin’s brutal invasion into their homeland.Putin’s ongoing attacks on Ukraine require that we think about what we can do to confront brutality. Almost three months into this unjustified war, the Polish people have been the model of stepping up to help in a time of need. Your country has rolled out the welcome mat, taking in over three million Ukrainian refugees.We at Treasury are also doing what we can to ensure that Putin’s brutal war is met with fierce resistance internationally. The United States and more than 30 of our partners have imposed unprecedented financial pressure measures on the Russian Federation and its leadership. We are firm in our resolve to hold Russia accountable and to strengthen the hand of the Ukrainian people at every turn.This moment calls for us to step up and do our part. I’m grateful to those who have introduced me to this moving museum, and I’ll continue to take these lessons of the past with me as we work toward a better future. Thank you very much."
298,,"May 11, 2022","I am deeply honored to present the Distinguished Leadership Award to my friend and long-time colleague, a gifted economist and a tireless civil servant—the Prime Minister of Italy, Mario Draghi.I really got to know Mario over dozens of dinners at the Bank for International Settlements during the time that he served as the Governor of the Bank of Italy and then as President of the European Central Bank.This was no easy time in the world of central banking. The global economy was shaken by a financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession. Mario was chosen as the first Chair of the Financial Stability Board, a consortium created to build a stronger global financial system—one that would be less crisis prone.Mario also charted a course to save the European economy and the euro itself, relying on his unique ability to bring people together—to forge consensus. He is known for a famous line in central banking history, declaring amid the European debt crisis that the ECB would “do whatever it takes” to preserve the euro. It is often said that those four words cemented the future of the eurozone. But it was the following statement—“And believe me, it will be enough”— that signaled Mario’s confidence and credibility. Financial markets, Europeans, and the world knew that he and the ECB could be trusted to deliver.Mario jumped back into public service becoming Prime Minister of Italy in early 2021 amid an unrelenting global pandemic and deep economic strains. In his first year, he oversaw Italy’s swift vaccination campaign, a series of relief measures to help workers and businesses, and a number of politically challenging reforms to modernize and green Italy’s economy. And on top of all that, he led a successful G20 year—a true testament to his commitment to multilateralism.Now in the face of Russia’s brutal and unjustified war against Ukraine, the United States has only strengthened our cooperation with Italy, and with the rest of our European and global partners, to stand firmly in support of Ukraine and the values that underpin our global economic order. As we have rolled out a historic package of sanctions, I have found great comfort in having a partner who deeply understands firsthand the plumbing of the international financial system. Who fully internalizes the impacts and intricacies of the consequential actions we are taking. I have deeply appreciated Mario’s counsel and wisdom throughout this latest challenge we are facing together.Mario, thank you for your service to Italy, to Europe, and to all of us.  I am honored to have worked so closely with you and look forward to our continued partnership.Without further ado, I ask you to join me in congratulating his excellency, Prime Minister Mario Draghi, as I present to him the Atlantic Council’s Distinguished Leadership Award."
299,,"April 27, 2022","WASHINGTON - Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen delivered remarks at the Brooking’s Hamilton and Hutchins Center event Recession Remedies: Lessons Learned from the US Economic Policy Response to COVID-19.I’d like to thank the Hamilton Project and the Hutchins Center for hosting this important conference.  I am especially honored to participate in today’s event with former Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin.  And I congratulate the authors of the volume on recession remedies for assembling a thoughtful collection of essays.  This book is a useful guide for policymakers preparing to address future economic challenges.Like many of the scholars engaged in this two-day event, I am no stranger to business cycles.  My career has spanned three years at the Council of Economic Advisers and almost two decades at the Federal Reserve.  Over this period, the U.S. has experienced seven recessions—varying in origin from a financial crisis to the bursting of the tech bubble to a global pandemic. Beginning in the mid-1980s, economists observed what they called the “Great Moderation.”  Many hypothesized that a combination of structural economic changes coupled with monetary policy innovations had permanently dampened the business cycle.  Unfortunately, the financial crisis of 2008 and the ensuing Great Recession dashed that hope.  Economies remain vulnerable to major shocks.  Most recently, the global pandemic, and now Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, underscore the likelihood of large economic shocks and disruptions that must be addressed.   Downturns are likely to continue to challenge the economy. Recessions exact heavy tolls.  For example, the average output loss during the last seven recessions is roughly 3.2% of GDP.  Excess unemployment—unemployment in excess of the estimated natural rate—during the ensuing recoveries averaged about 4.5 percentage points.  Moreover, deep and long-lasting recessions appear to permanently lower the path of potential output.  Thus, entirely appropriately, policymakers typically seek to mitigate these costs by implementing policies designed to ignite a quick and strong recovery.  That is one of the most important responsibilities of policymakers and has been a central focus of the Biden Administration since the outset.  A first observation is that, conditional on the inevitability of large negative shocks, countries will fare better if their economies are more resilient and less fragile.  Research that improves our understanding of the transmission channels of disruptive shocks can improve our resilience.  Improved understanding of breaks in supply chains, increases in commodity prices, bursting of asset bubbles, and labor and productivity shocks can help policymakers implement reforms that bolster our economic resilience. To take one example, a wealth of research preceding the financial crisis of 2008, but not sufficiently appreciated at that time, has now given policymakers a much better understanding of the linkages between financial markets and the real economy.  It explains how risks to financial stability emerge and how policymakers can monitor the economy to detect growing threats in real time.  Importantly, it explores financial regulations that are needed to diminish financial stability risks.  In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated new regulations intended to diminish financial sector fragility.  Far more stringent capital and liquidity standards were imposed on America’s largest and most systemic banks. The effectiveness of these measures was tested during the pandemic.  They enabled America’s banks to weather the pandemic shock while meeting the credit needs of a recovering economy.  But the crisis also revealed that significant vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector had not been addressed, and, consequently, the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Biden Administration are working to mitigate these remaining threats. In recent weeks, energy price movements have been another significant source of global economic shocks.  The Biden Administration’s proposed energy agenda is designed to diminish our reliance on fossil fuels and help achieve greater energy independence.  These shifts will mitigate our future vulnerability to oil price shocks.  At the same time, they will abet the transition to cleaner energy sources which will, in due course, lessen the risks tied to natural disasters and climate change.  Over the long run, such measures will reduce volatility while also lessening the depth of future recessions.In addition to improving the resilience of the economy to shocks, it is imperative to build and maintain an effective and efficient set of recession remedies—recovery policies that shorten the duration of recessions and mitigate economic pain.  The construction of these recovery policies must be informed by lived experience and rigorous evaluation of prior approaches, including those employed to address the economic devastation of 2020 and the beginning of 2021—which is, of course, the central focus of this convening.I will offer some reactions to the newly released volume.  And I will suggest some further guiding principles for recovery policy.  But let me first pause to reflect on the current recovery and the progress that has been made over the past year and a half.From a historical perspective, it is important to emphasize that we have already witnessed a rapid recovery buoyed by a substantial government response—beginning with the CARES Act at the start of the pandemic, and continuing with the Consolidated Appropriations Act in late 2020, and the American Rescue Plan enacted in early 2021.  These federal fiscal actions were complemented by an unprecedented response by the Federal Reserve along with relief instituted by national and subnational governments and central banks abroad.These responses played major roles in igniting a robust recovery.  Notably, the American Rescue Plan played a central role in driving strong growth throughout 2021, with the United States real GDP growth outpacing other advanced economies and our labor market recovering faster relative to historical experience.  This has meant diminished scarring and less human suffering.  Even through Delta and Omicron—and now a global supply shock due to Putin’s unprovoked actions in Ukraine—the Rescue Plan has allowed our economy to face unknown risks from a position of strength.First, these policies were adopted under conditions of substantial uncertainty.  Throughout 2020, and into 2021, the path of the pandemic, including its severity and the role of future viral strains could not be predicted.  Given this uncertainty, the recovery packages sought to protect against tail risk.  They were not just tailored to address the median outcome.  Let me be clear: the tail risk in 2020 and 2021 was a downturn that could match the Great Depression.It is fairly easy to evaluate policies ex post.   But it is important to remember the dire economic projections prevailed throughout the early days of the pandemic.  In a survey conducted in the spring of 2020, 37 percent of small business owners expected to be closed by year’s end. Zillow’s baseline scenario for the housing market was a 60 percent decline in sales with no price appreciation across 2020 and most of 2021.  In mid-2020 the Congressional Budget Office projected that the unemployment rate would average 9.3 percent over 2021.  And, even in early 2021, the labor market recovery had stalled and the Blue Chip consensus projected years of elevated unemployment.  These were not worst-case scenarios, but rather baseline projections.  Tail risk scenarios were much worse.Second, the scars from the Great Recession were still quite fresh.  Less than a decade earlier, the United States had lived through an extended, and oftentimes slow, economic recovery in which Americans became detached from the labor market, lost homes en masse, entered bankruptcy and debt collection at alarming rates, and endured scarring that would last a lifetime.  Policymakers understood the imperative of exiting the downturn as quickly as possible and ensuring that support reached those workers and households at greatest risk of that scarring. These factors influenced the design of the policies that were implemented.  Moreover, as has occurred in times of crisis, it is evident that some policy approaches presented significant implementation challenges throughout the pandemic.  These factors highlight the need for reform of our recovery infrastructure.In this vein, the Hamilton and Hutchins volume seeks to learn from recent experience and identify key lessons for policymakers.  It is an important effort, and there are many critical lessons to be gleaned from these studies.  I’d like to highlight a handful of points that I consider particularly salient.  Ganong, Greig, Pascal, Sullivan, and Vavra argue that unemployment insurance modernization is critical.  I strongly agree.  In their words: “The trade-off between speed and accuracy does not have to exist.”  In that regard, recent actions taken by the Labor Department to modernize unemployment insurance by preventing fraud, improving access, and reducing backlogs represent meaningful progress and are key steps.  Gelman and Stephens helpfully explain that stimulus payments can be an effective mechanism for injecting cash into the economy quickly, but we must also continue to study the interplay between cash support and the social safety net.  The authors note, for example, that with long delays in the receipt of unemployment insurance and significant earnings losses even for workers who retained employment, rapid receipt of cash assistance served as a partial offset.  But better understanding of these interactions will help us pinpoint when and how cash assistance should be delivered. Willen, Gerardi, and Lambie-Hansen rightly assess that mortgage forbearance relief was a successful element of the relief effort and a promising approach in future recovery packages,   although it was neither costless nor a panacea.  Throughout the pandemic, the combination of forbearance relief and the support from Treasury’s Homeownership Assistance Fund has provided an important tool to preserve housing stability for American homeowners at risk.Following Goodman and Wachter, the crisis has exposed the need for a more permanent rental safety net.  Housing stability is a foremost concern not just in downturns, but in recoveries as well.  During this crisis, Treasury was at the forefront of establishing—for the first time—a national effort at scale for rental assistance.  Emergency Rental Assistance has not only helped to keep evictions below their pre-pandemic levels, it has also enabled states and localities to build an infrastructure for rental assistance going forward. Finally, Aizer and Persico surmise that the rapid and sizable policy response will have long-term payoffs in terms of childhood outcomes including nutrition, health, and academic achievement.  Indeed, I predict that researchers will establish that the Biden Administration’s expanded Child Tax Credit increased childhood wellbeing during this crisis.The preceding lessons come from interventions associated with the 2020 recession.  There are also general lessons from the pandemic experience and from past recessions.        First, it is imperative to address the specific source of crises.  In 2008, recovery would have been impossible without recapitalizing and restoring confidence in the banking system.  In 2020, in contrast, recovery was tied to the progress of the pandemic.  Vaccine dissemination has been the most important element of the response.  Other crises will have different origins.  It will be critical to address their root cause.Second, we must consider equity.  Downturns are often most destructive for the most vulnerable neighborhoods and populations, and especially communities of color.  The American Rescue Plan made sure that funds reached those communities with the most serious damage.  That included, for example: flexible rental assistance programs that did not exclude the neediest renters because of overly stringent documentation requirements; targeted outreach in a range of languages; and state and local funds used for investments targeted to communities especially vulnerable to the pandemic.Third, effective automatic stabilizers—called “workhorse antirecession programs” in the 2019 book Recession Ready—are perhaps the most important policy tool, which is why President Biden proposed them in his original Rescue Plan proposal.  Every recession in recent decades has reinforced the need for a flexible, automatic response.  Well-designed automatic stabilizers are the best remedy.  Preparing for the next recession means not only improving existing stabilizers but expanding their reach to other forms of social support and building the “pipes” to distribute relief in a timely manner.   Fourth, it is necessary to preserve attachment to the labor force in an economic downturn.  As a hangover from the Great Recession, the long-term unemployed and those out of the labor force continue to suffer its scars.  While we need more work to best target our policy response, in recent years we’ve worked with multiple new policy levers to keep workers on payroll and off long-term unemployment.  And the strength of the American Rescue Plan has no doubt contributed to the record fall in long-term unemployment—a strong and positive contrast to the lingering high numbers of long-term unemployed that we saw after the Great Recession.    Fifth, policymakers must support basic human needs, including housing, health care, and nutrition.  Denial of access not only results in immediate suffering, but also has long-term consequences as well.  Programs like the Biden Administration’s expanded Child Tax Credit and Economic Impact Payments provided umbrella support for these needs, but more targeted in-kind relief can also be an effective tool.Lastly, we need to invest in measurement, oversight, and accountability to improve impact.  Economists and other researchers need high-quality, high-frequency data to assess the depth of recession in real time and to adequately evaluate the success of policy interventions.  The rapid onset of the pandemic recession dramatically highlighted the need for better data.  And despite admirable creativity by researchers in 2020 to assess the state of the economy, we must invest now in better tools for monitoring.  Similarly, comprehensive oversight and accountability safeguards—designed in advance—are necessary to ensure that public resources are appropriately deployed.  In conclusion, I commend the Hamilton Project, the Hutchins Center, and the contributing authors for this important volume.  Legislation over the past two years, unprecedented in size and scope, was informed by a rich literature directed at improving recovery policies. The pandemic’s toll would have been much worse if not for policy response informed by careful study.  The research and insight presented in this volume will help guide America through future recessions.  On behalf of the millions of Americans whose lives will be affected, I thank you."
300,,"April 22, 2022","WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Ministers representing the membership of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) agreed on strategic priorities for the organization and to increase efforts to fight corruption. “We strongly encourage the FATF to pursue work on the misuse of citizenship by investment schemes and on financial enablers used by corrupt actors, as well as additional operational work on the tracing and seizure of corrupt proceeds,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “The United States welcomes the Ministers’ recognition of the serious impact that systemic corruption has on our economies and societies.”Strengthening the FATF global network and sharpening its focus on increasing beneficial ownership transparency, as the FATF Ministers agreed to do yesterday, are key U.S. priorities in the fight against corruption. Ministers also agreed that the ongoing Russian invasion runs counter to the FATF core principles and represents a gross violation of the commitment FATF Ministers have made to implement and support the FATF standards. "
301,,"April 21, 2022","Thank you for being here. This has been a very productive week and I’d like to thank the IMF and World Bank – as well as my counterparts in Germany and Indonesia at the G7 and G20 respectively – for their leadership this week.A significant amount of our focus this week has been on Russia’s reckless, devastating, and illegal war against Ukraine, and our allies coming together on what more we can do to support the Ukrainian government and people as they fight for their homeland.This morning, I met with the Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal. I shared with him our continued, firm stance alongside Ukraine as they defend their lives and their country. I am committed to working with our partners and allies to support Ukraine’s economic needs in the short and long term. In the meeting, I shared the United States’ commitment to another $500 million of immediate funding to help Ukraine continue critical government operations, such as salaries, pensions, and other social assistance programs, necessary to avoid a worsening of the humanitarian situation in Ukraine. This builds on the $500 million that President Biden committed to President Zelensky in March.The needs of Ukraine are urgent, and we plan to deploy this direct aid to Ukraine as soon as possible to be used on the most urgent needs. We know this is only the beginning of what Ukraine will need to rebuild and I’m committed to working with Congress, and with our international allies and partners to build on this support in the medium and long term.The power of working together with our partners has been essential in supporting Ukraine – and in confronting Russia. In fact, Russia's war brought about the kind of swift and multilateral response not seen for decades.  The coalition includes more than 30 countries from around the globe who represent more than 50% of the global economy, issue the world’s most widely used convertible currencies, and produce the world’s cutting-edge technologies. The tremendous blow on the Russian economy resulting from of our sanctions is only possible because of the breadth of our coalition.This week, our partners and allies agreed to continue united efforts to maximize economic pressure on Russia. Yesterday, we continued to tighten the vice of our economic pressure campaign against Russia by targeting financial and operational support networks used in attempts to evade U.S. sanctions. Treasury sanctioned a Russian bank at the heart of such efforts as well as a network of cut outs, proxies, and facilitators used by the oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev.I want to mention, before taking your questions, the rising threat of food insecurity. I am deeply concerned about this risk to emerging and developing countries, particularly those still recovering from the pandemic. There is a very real risk that soaring global market prices of food and fertilizer will result in more people going hungry, further exacerbate inflation, and harm government fiscal and external positions.  We are doing everything we can both bilaterally and through the IFIs to address the food security risks.  I convened a productive meeting this week with counterparts where we discussed developing and putting into action ways to address the growing crisis of 275 million people around the world facing acute food insecurity, and over 800 million people facing chronic food insecurity.  We will share more action items resulting from that meeting in the coming weeks.Lastly, we also discussed the global need to end the pandemic and prevent future ones. Global health emergencies are no longer a once-in-a-generation threat, and we must act now so that the tragic impacts of Covid do not reoccur. Our top priority is to end the COVID-19 pandemic, and we must press forward to overcome the hurdles to vaccinating at least 70 percent of the population in all countries. But we also need to learn the lessons of this pandemic and advance plans to reform the global health security architecture. With increasing pandemic threats, climate change, and conflict, experts agree COVID-19 will not be our last major global health emergency.Q: Thank you Secretary. Do you believe that European allies should move faster and join the US on imposing a full ban on Russian energy imports to maintain the financial pressure on Russia and cut off what is an enduring the source of funding for the war? Or are you concerned that such a step would be too drastic in damaging European economies with possible spillover effects?SEC. YELLEN: So, our objective from the outset has been to impose maximum pain on Russia while attempting to mitigate damage to the United States to Europe and throughout the global economy. In the case of oil and natural gas, clearly, Europe's situation is different than that of the United States. So, we did ban Russian energy imports of all types, but we imported, very little from Russia to start with that isn’t true for Europe. For the medium term, Europe clearly needs to reduce its dependence on Russia with respect to energy. But we need to be careful when we think about a complete European ban on say oil imports. We want to harm Russia that would clearly raise global oil prices would have a damaging impact on Europe and other parts of the world. And counterintuitively it could actually have very little negative impact on Russia because although Russia might export less, its price for its exports would go up. So, I think it's important of course, proceeds from sales of oil and gas are an important source of income for Russia. It would be very useful to try to devise a way to reduce proceeds from those sales and that really is the proper objective I think of a ban. But if we can think of a way to do that without harming the entire world from higher energy prices that would be ideal and it’s a matter that we’re all trying to think of and we're all trying to work through together.Q: Thank you very much, Secretary Yellen. Can you describe some of the specific measures that you and your counterparts have been talking about to ease food price inflation that's been amplified on sanctions on Russia, and are you concerned that greater fragmentation of global economy where countries concentrate trade amongst each other could lead to permanently higher prices?SEC. YELLEN: So, with respect to specific measures, we will have a little bit more for you with specific detail in the coming weeks. There were technical discussions among experts, but certainly taking every measure we can to bolster food supplies, which means we make sure that planting continue after all the price of fertilizer has gone up, making sure that yields are preserved so small farmers can afford fertilizer. So, taking all the steps we can to bolster the supply of food while taking steps as well to make sure that the social safety nets are working in countries with food insecurity because often when there's a shortage of food and prices are high you can see export controls or things that even when hypothetically there's enough supply of food to supply the needs of a population it doesn't get to the poorest people. So, measures on both the supply and demand are appropriate. We are thinking through concrete steps that we can get back to you on.SEC. YELLEN: We have developed supply chains that are extremely efficient and serve to lower costs. But as we discovered during the pandemic, and more recently now with Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our supply chains are not secure and are not resilient. I think that’s something in terms of long-term risk to the U.S. and to other countries that is a threat that needs to be addressed. And I think if countries go in a fully protectionist direction saying we need to do everything ourselves at home that could be a lot more expensive in terms of costs that producers face, which is why in the talk I gave last week at the Atlantic Council. I mentioned this idea of networks or friend sharing or trust networks. Ideally, we would have a large group of trusted partners so that we can maintain the efficiencies that come from the global division of labor, but also feel more secure about the supplies we have in so there may be some cost to bear and permanently with higher inflation, but just a somewhat higher local costs, somewhat less efficient system, but one that is more resilient, but I think this approach of friend-sharing is a way to manage that trade off.Q: Thank you, Secretary Yellen. There have been a number of suggestions that the U.S. we use some of the frozen central bank reserves from Russia to help support Ukraine as a result of the war. Do you think the U.S. has the authority to do that or would it require some legislative changes by Congress and with the Treasury support such legislation?SEC. YELLEN: It's clear that building costs of Ukraine are going to be enormous. Certainly, looking to Russia one way or another to help provide some of what's necessary for Ukraine is something to build is something I think we ought to be pursuing. In the United States, I am unclear whether or not it would be possible without legislation authorizing the use of those assets. More generally, I would say that is very significant, and it is one that we would carefully need to think through the consequences of before undertaking it. I wouldn’t want to do so lightly and it’s something that I think our coalition and partners would need to feel comfortable with and be supportive of. I think we would need to have those discussions and think through those issues before I would want to say what our position would be on that.Q: Hi Secretary Yellen. Thanks. Yesterday you and a number of U.S. allies walked out of the G20 meeting when the Russian officials started to speak. I just wonder how you see this forum going forward. Do you expect this thing to continue to happen? How does the G20 accomplish what it needs to on debt relief and climate changes things and things that it is charged with working on if you sort of can’t agree on communiques. I also wanted to get a little more detail on your views on revamping the international financial architecture you discussed the other day at the Atlantic Council.
 SEC. YELLEN: Sure. So, you know, I think it's simply cannot be business as usual for Russia in terms of its participation in our global forums whether it's G20 or other forums, where to address common challenges. I think participation in those forums really requires commitment on the part of countries to the fundamental norms and values underlying international cooperation. And my decision to work with others to leave when the Russian finance minister began to speak was intended to make clear Russia's behavior so violates, is so offensive to international norms, we're not willing to allow Russia to participate or to listen to what the Russians have to say. Now, to remove a country from any participation requires a very high level of agreement in any forums, including the G20, and there wasn’t that level of agreement, but I think we look for a way to make our disapproval known while still recognizing we have a lot of work to accomplish.A key piece of that work is meeting to discuss the impact of Russia’s horrible war of choice on the global economy, to talk about food insecurity, rising energy prices and the like, and we are continuing to get that work done in all the forums I'm participating in this week, while making clear that we thoroughly disapprove of Russia’s involvement. So, President Biden has made clear as we know, with which I agree, that Russia should be removed from participation in the G20, but we’ll see where we go moving forward.You also asked about my comments on redesigning Bretton Woods institutions. So, I think after World War Two, we set up the WTO where its predecessor began in the IMF, the World Bank, and I think they're playing a very constructive role in managing the challenges of integrating global economy in the entire post war period. So, we need those institutions, and they continue to do very important work, but there are challenges they face in this day and age that they weren't really designed to deal with. In the case of the IMF, just to give an example, the IMF was intended to help individual countries facing shocks or internal macro problems they add that face balance of payments crisis to enable individual countries to meet their needs for external financing while undertaking structural reforms. It wasn't designed to address a global challenge, like the pandemic that created growing problems for the largest number of countries or especially low income countries participating in global economy, or the challenges that entire global economy face after the global financial crisis in 2008, or today when we have a Russia-induced crisis that is causing – especially when coupled with a pandemic -- most countries with already high debt are now facing really unmanageable debt, many countries and not due to any failings of their own macroeconomic policies but due to huge external shock., I can't tell you what the answer is, but to work the appropriate forums are to look to the IMF to be the kind of global lender of last resort. And I think that's an important function for them to play.In the case of the World Bank, I think the original idea was a large number of countries don't have access to capital in global markets and created an institution to provide project financing. Well, the times have changed and now many of those countries do have access to financial markets. And we face challenges that require investment on a scale that an international institutional can’t manage on its own-- like climate change. And the investments needed for climate change will add on up to just trillions and trillions of dollars. We have pools of private capital that are clearly ready, willing, and able, to make investments around the world in emerging markets, in infrastructure, in energy, renewable energy to address climate change. But maybe the conditions need to be right in the World Bank and other multilateral development banks, need to figure out how to move that capital and make the investments that are required and safer. So, I think that is a new function.The other aspect of it is there are global public goods. And we've been discussing this in connection with preparing for future pandemics. We need countries around the world to have basic public health infrastructure that will let us rapidly respond to the next pandemic, and many low-income countries don't have that in place. And that's not something that's just at the benefit of individual country, it’s to our benefit. Because as we know, when you have a pandemic, if you don't address it throughout the entire world, no one around the world will be safe from the development of new variants. So, we're creating, we hope to create at the G20, to set up a Finance Ministers Task Force. We are discussing the creation of the special fund at the World Bank called the Financial Intermediary Fund to which members might make contributions to meet this need. But just the provision of global public goods in general – it seems like a logical goal for the World Bank and multilateral development banks, but perhaps requires some slightly altered mandate in governance of the multilateral development banks to succeed.Q: Good morning, Secretary Yellen. I'd also like to refer back to the speech that you gave last week at the Atlantic Council, in which you said, “The world's attitude towards China, and its willingness to embrace further economic integration may well be affected by China's reaction to our call for resolute action on Russia.” I'm wondering if China is judged to not be contributing to this resolute action on Russia, can you be clearer or specific about what exactly you're proposing the US and its allies would or should do with respect to China.SEC. YELLEN: So, I don't mean to be making any specific proposal. I didn't have anything specific in mind. But this is a time when those who are in favor of the core institutions in the global system and core set of values are standing together to address threats to that system. And China has been a part of it. And China has benefited from that system, and over decades, wanted to participate in that system. And I simply think that not only the United States, but many countries, want to see China show that it understands the threats the global system faces because of China’s behavior. And to show their own adherence and appreciation of the value of that system. And to be on the side of being helpful to all the countries that are trying to protect the core functioning of our global system.Going forward, we would be less trustful of China, if China fails to show that adherence to core values. It could play out in a whole variety of ways. But you know, when you think about trusted and secure trading networks, supply chain networks, it can play a role there and probably in other ways as well.Q: Thank you Secretary Yellen. The IMF chief has said that Ukraine needs five billion dollars a month in order to sustain its economy and rebuild, and that number could go up -- where exactly will this money be coming from? Secondly, yesterday, there was a new set of sanctions that were imposed including on a cryptocurrency firm. And the Administration and Treasury have said that cryptocurrency is not a major way of evading sanctions. We’re curious if this new set of sanctions on the crypto firm indicates a rethinking of that.SEC. YELLEN: I’m sorry, remind me the first thing that you asked – this is about crypto and then where the money is coming from? Ok yes, where the money is coming from.Well, we're having discussions this week in the G7 and in several international financial institutions and in fact, we have a meeting this afternoon that I'll be attending the heads of the IMF and World Bank, the Ukrainian president will be speaking to the to the group. And we will discuss financing needs and how to raise that money. But, as I’ve mentioned, today we’ve doubled our contribution, we’ve given a billion dollars that will be immediately available to Ukraine. There have been other contributions. I think we stand united in recognizing we've got to find ways to meet Ukraine’s needs. And on our part, it will involve going back to Congress with a supplemental request -- I'm not in a position to give any details. But I'm certainly committed to working with Congress to ask for their help to meet Ukraine’s needs. I think all of us are. The G20 met with, we met with the finance minister, the Ukrainian finance minister. I, just before this, was with Ukraine’s prime minister and finance minister and we were inspired by their courage and stand with them and will do everything we can to pull our resources to support the needs that are identified.On cryptocurrency -- So I don't think we have seen widespread evasion of sanctions yet. But certainly, there are attempts in Russia to evade these sanctions. Crypto is one of the ways in which -- along with others -- in which sanctions can occur. And we've said that also we haven’t seen broad evasion, and it’s hard to imagine that occurring using crypto. We intend to make sure that our sanctions stick. When we discover routes that are being used to evade them, we intend to crack down on them, and that’s what we’ve done.Q: Thank you, Secretary Yellen. The World Bank President was talking about humanitarian catastrophe from this combination of food crisis and sovereign debt crisis. These countries were told advice to increase borrowing during the pandemic. And now they face rising interest rates, partly because of the actions of the US Federal Reserve on impossible borrowing costs. Do you think the Federal Reserve should take into account the impact on potential developing country crises when it sets interest rates? And more generally, is it time for a widespread systemic series of debt relief with these types of low-income countries that can't afford their pandemic debts?SEC. YELLEN: Let me say that, even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, we were concerned and we have been quite concerned and it's a regular matter we’ve discussed in G20, the IMF, in other fora, that many lower income countries have unsustainable burdens. First, we had the DSSI debt suspension and sustainability initiative. And then designed a process called the Common Framework that was intended to manage debt restructuring for countries with unsustainable debt. And we’ve been very disappointed – at least I will say I have been very disappointed – by the failure of that framework to deliver relief for more countries. And I’ve explicitly called out China. China is a very significant lender to many of these lower income countries, and China needs to participate, along with the Paris Club and private creditors. I've called on China to, specifically, for example, participate right away for Zambia, which wishes to undergo debt restructuring. And I'm hopeful that China will agree to play a more constructive role, but there are quite a number of countries who want to be candidates for that. And of course, humanitarian and global economic disaster due to do the war in Ukraine further exacerbates this problem. But I think that's the way we need to go.Q: Secretary Yellen, I wanted to ask about, in reference to your remarks last week at the Atlantic Council, the countries still sitting on the fence that are not China -- I'm curious if your message to them is the same in terms of, if you don’t side with us you may be left out of the supply-chain networks or the friend sharing system. What do you say to some of these other countries? What do you have in mind those countries?SEC. YELLEN: Well, there are a number of countries who have maintained neutrality or not come out as opposed to Russia's actions. And to all of them, I think the message is the same -- that what we're seeing here violates the basic norms of behavior that’s expected, that’s embedded in the UN charter and expected of all countries that participate in the global economy and our governance institutions. And we really urge them to take actions to condemn Russia’s behavior. But beyond that, we certainly want to make sure that they do not need evade sanctions or provide any active support to Russia."
302,,"April 19, 2022","Good morning.  Welcome, Honorable Finance Ministers of Germany and Indonesia, Christian Lindner and Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who are joining us as this year’s finance chairs of the G7 and G20, respectively. I am also pleased to have President Gilbert Houngbo, President David Malpass, and Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva here today, as the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are actively responding to the global impacts of the war in Ukraine.I wish we were meeting under different circumstances.  But the reality is that we are facing rising global food insecurity. This threat touches the most vulnerable people the hardest – families that are already spending disproportionate amounts of their income on food. Moreover, the interconnectedness of the global food system means that people on every continent are impacted.Even before the war, over 800 million people were suffering from chronic food insecurity.  That’s 10 percent of global population, and more than the populations of our panelists’ five home countries combined.  Poor nutrition and food insecurity have serious implications for economic well-being, and social and political stability.The war has made an already dire situation worse.  Price and supply shocks are already materializing, adding to global inflationary pressures, creating risks to external balances, and undermining the recovery from the pandemic.I want to be clear: Russia’s actions are responsible for this. But the United States is urgently working with our partners and allies to help mitigate the effects of Russia’s reckless war on the world’s most vulnerable. Let there be no doubt – even as we continue escalating our sanctions and other economic measures against Russia, we reiterate our commitment to authorizing essential humanitarian and related activities that benefit people around the world – ensuring the availability of basic foodstuffs and agricultural commodities. First, let’s better understand the drivers of rising global food insecurity, including underlying vulnerabilities that pre-dated this war.  Recent increases in food insecurity have been driven by conflict, climate change, and economic downturns, such as those associated with the pandemic.  In 2020, the number of people experiencing chronic food insecurity increased by a devastating 160 million.   Today, Russia’s destruction of the Ukrainian economy and its infrastructure is a key factor affecting global commodity prices.  The war further exacerbates pre-existing price and food supply pressures.  Some countries and regions, which were already food insecure and facing emergencies, are now confronting additional price increases and supply disruptions for imported food, fuel, and fertilizers.  Early estimates suggest that at least 10 million more people could be pushed into poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa due to higher food prices alone. Second, we should focus on how we can apply valuable lessons learned from past global food price crises to the current context.  We know that we must avoid export restrictions that could further increase prices.  We must quickly support the most vulnerable populations with social safety nets and provide targeted support for smallholder farmers so they can continue to produce.  And we must not lose sight of the need to strengthen longer-term resilience, because this latest shock will unfortunately not be the last.In response to the 2008 crisis, the G20 launched the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program to increase investment in the world’s poorest countries and an agricultural market information system.  We must consider how these tools can be used – and reinvigorated, if needed – to meet the needs of this moment.And finally, let’s get concrete about the actions the international financial institutions can take to deliver an effective response.  The IFIs are well-placed to work with affected countries and partners to develop solutions. They can use their analytical tools to assess the specific needs of affected countries while also evaluating the macroeconomic impacts of the war.  They can help mitigate the global fertilizer shortage and smooth supply chain disruptions for food and critical supplies. They can increase investments in agricultural capacity and resilience to boost domestic food production. And they can provide targeted assistance and strengthen social safety nets to protect vulnerable people in the short term and build their resilience over the longer term. We have a strong international system, and we need to work together now.  I know that my colleagues on this panel will set high expectations for what the system must deliver.After this panel, my colleague Alexia Latortue, Assistant Secretary for International Trade and Development, will convene technical experts from the international financial institutions, including the multilateral development banks, IFAD, and the IMF, to develop an action plan for an effective and coordinated response."
303,,"April 19, 2022","The most recent report from the IPCC underscored the urgency with which we need to act to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Unfortunately, Russia’s war of choice in Ukraine has made it even more challenging to keep a global warming limit of 1.5 degrees within reach as we grapple with the fallout from a new major geopolitical and humanitarian catastrophe that imperils international economic cooperation.  Europe is currently focused on its plans to reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels by diversifying supply chains and doubling down on clean energy investments.  These efforts highlight the need for us all to take actions that safeguard our energy needs and build resilience to market volatility. We know that a key path to energy security runs through renewable energy. Our priority – not only in the United States and Europe, but globally – should be on increasing deployment of energy efficiency measures while rapidly scaling up clean energy capacity. And of course, for many emerging markets this must be done while also expanding energy access.This will require hard decisions and economic investments. Existing fossil fuel infrastructure is working against us, driving us instead towards reaching climate tipping points this decade.  Today we need to collectively choose the future we want through public policy design and expediting investments in sustainable infrastructure.  At the same time, we understand that every country’s path to net-zero will look a bit different, and our policy decisions will reflect the unique circumstances in each jurisdiction.  This only underscores the need for us to enhance international coordination and carry forward work to better understand the relationship between the policy levers available to us and their cross-border distributional and macroeconomic effects. I also welcome the launch of the new report “Driving Climate Action through Economic and Fiscal Policy and Practice.”  And I am also pleased that the United States is co-leading the effort with Denmark to mainstream climate into economic policy under Helsinki Principle 4.The report highlights that while finance ministries collectively work to reduce our emissions today and into the future, we must also not lose sight of the global needs to adapt to the impacts of an already changing climate.Adaption is a core priority for so many countries that are already facing the harsh impacts of climate change today.  It is not a choice – it is matter of survival. At COP26, the U.S. government launched PREPARE, the President’s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience, which outlines a coordinated approach that will put into action the largest U.S. commitment ever made to reduce climate impacts on those most vulnerable to climate change worldwide.As the Coalition continues its 2022 work, I encourage us to seek out opportunities to work with Egypt heading towards its COP27 Presidency. We should build on the COP26 success and again demonstrate the importance of finance, and finance ministries, in addressing the climate crisis."
304,,"November 27, 2023","WASHINGTON – From November 26 – December 1, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
305,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
306,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
307,,"November 21, 2023",
308,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
309,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

310,,"April 7, 2022","WASHINGTON — Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen delivered remarks on digital assets policy, innovation, and regulation at American University’s Kogod School of Business Center for Innovation.
Thank you, President Burwell, for that kind introduction – it is good to be with you again. I am so happy to be at American University where changemakers are changing the world. Groundbreaking leaders in government, academia, and business have walked these halls, and I am pleased to be here to discuss the Biden Administration’s approach to digital assets.
A few weeks ago, President Biden signed an Executive Order calling for a coordinated and comprehensive government approach to digital asset policy. Digital assets have grown explosively, reaching a market cap of $3 trillion last November from $14 billion just five years prior.
Digital assets may be relatively new, but they are part of a larger trend – the digitization of finance – that has been in the making for decades. In 1990, there were fewer than 3 million internet users. Now, there are about 4.5 billion, and we take for granted that many aspects of our financial lives can be managed from small internet-connected devices that fit into the palms of our hands.
This growth in digital services has opened a world of possibilities and risks that would have seemed fantastical only a few decades ago. Financial services – along with most industries – have evolved in response to exponential advances in computing power and connectivity.
Most recently, new technology has raised the possibility of reduced reliance on centralized intermediaries like banks and credit card companies. In 2008, a person – or group of people – using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto proposed a decentralized peer-to-peer system for making and processing payments. A key challenge in digital payments is to prevent the same assets from being spent twice.  The Bitcoin white paper proposed a novel method for validating transactions using cryptography that addressed the so-called “double spend” problem. This and other innovations related to distributed ledger technology are the foundation for blockchain-based digital assets.   
Over time, the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been quite volatile, which has inhibited their widespread use in payments. Adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments may be further inhibited by high fees and slower processing times than those associated with other forms of payment. As a practical matter, you’d have a hard time using cryptocurrency to buy a sandwich or a gallon of milk. Other digital assets – like stablecoins or potential Central Bank Digital Currencies – could succeed at being more widely used as a means of exchange, raising potential benefits and risks.
Proponents believe distributed ledger technology will transform other aspects of financial services like trading, borrowing, and lending. They point to capabilities, like smart contracts, which use computer code to automatically execute an agreement if certain prespecified conditions are met. To the extent that setup is more convenient, and costs are competitive with those required for traditional financial services, digital assets offer the potential to expand access. 
President Biden’s Executive Order tasked experts across the federal government with conducting in-depth analysis to balance the responsible development of digital assets with the risks they present. These tasks will be guided by six policy objectives: first, protect consumers, investors, and businesses; second, safeguard financial stability from systemic risk; third, mitigate national security risks; fourth, promote US leadership and economic competitiveness; fifth, promote equitable access to safe and affordable financial services; and, finally, support responsible technological advances, which take account of important design considerations like those related to privacy, human rights, and climate change. Over approximately the next six months, Treasury will work with colleagues in the White House and other agencies to produce foundational reports and recommendations related to these objectives. In many cases, the work tasked by the Executive Order builds upon ongoing efforts at Treasury.
I won’t predict where this work will take us, but that does not mean we are navigating without a compass. Digital assets may be new, but many of the issues they present are not. We have enjoyed the benefits of innovation in the past, and we have also confronted some of the unintended consequences.
Today, I want to share five lessons that apply as we navigate the opportunities and challenges posed by these emerging technologies. These lessons relate to the nature of responsible innovation, the structure of appropriate guardrails, the fundamentals of the financial system, our role in the global economy, and the value of collaboration.New technologies build on older ones and a chain of innovation has transformed financial services over time. Seventy years ago, most Americans used coins, cash, and checks to manage most aspects of their financial lives. Then, in the 1960s, an engineer from IBM attached a magnetic strip to a plastic card and sparked a new category of payment products: credit and debit cards. Those innovations facilitated the growth of other technologies, like ATMs, which made cash available 24/7. More recently, computers, the internet, and mobile phones have driven the explosive growth of electronic payments and online commerce. 
Although new technologies have made our financial system more efficient for most Americans, many transactions still take too long to settle. A combination of technological factors and business incentives have produced a common frustrating experience shared by tens of millions of Americans every week: their employer sends their paycheck, but it takes up to two days for the check to hit their bank account.  The delay contributes to the use of high-cost check cashers or ‘pay day’ lenders to get their money in time to pay their bills. Some are forced to draw against already low balances and are charged overdraft fees. Estimates suggest Americans spend $15 billion or more each year on such fees and services – essentially a tax of about $100 dollars per working American, due mostly to inefficiency, and disproportionately borne by people with lower incomes.
If you live in a G7 country, you may pay below two percent in transaction and conversion fees to send money across the border. If you live in the developing world, you may pay as high as ten percent. These high costs disproportionately impact the 250 million-plus migrants around the world who send an average of $200 to $300 in remittances to their families each month. Proponents of digital assets envision a more efficient payment system with instantaneous transactions and lower costs no matter where you live.
Will the technology live up to that promise? I think it’s too early to tell. Issues like processing time, cost, and technological barriers to access will need to be overcome. The US is actively involved in the work of the G20 to address challenges and frictions with cross-border funds transfers. And, in 2023 the Federal Reserve plans to launch FedNow, an instant payment service that will enable payment in real time, around the clock, every day of the year within the US’ payments system. 
Some have also suggested that the introduction of a Central Bank Digital Currency, or “CBDC”, could contribute to a more efficient payment system. As a liability of the central bank, a CBDC could become a form of trusted money comparable to physical cash, but potentially offering some of the projected benefits of digital assets.
Under the Executive Order, the Administration will publish a report on the future of money and payments. The report will analyze possible design choices related to a potential CBDC and implications for payment systems, economic growth, financial stability, financial inclusion, and national security.
Innovation that improves our lives while appropriately managing risks should be embraced. But we must also be mindful that “financial innovation” of the past has too often not benefited working families, and has sometimes exacerbated inequality, given rise to illicit finance risks, and increased systemic financial risk.We learned this painful lesson during the Global Financial Crisis. Financial institutions called “shadow banks” and an explosion of new financial products allowed dangerous levels of risks to accumulate. Beginning in 2007, investors grew wary of these risks, and some large institutions began to falter. Soon, people who’d never heard of a “shadow bank” or a subprime mortgage-backed security ended up losing their jobs and life savings. The S&P 500 fell by more than half and household net worth dropped precipitously.  The resulting economic distress was most acute and long-lasting for Black Americans and other Americans of color. We need to ensure that the growth of digital assets does not allow similarly dangerous risks to emerge or lead to disproportionate impacts to vulnerable communities.
Already, the Treasury has worked with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, the FDIC, and OCC to study stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable source of value, often the US dollar. Stablecoins raise policy concerns, including those related to illicit finance, user protection, and systemic risk. And, they are currently subject to inconsistent and fragmented oversight.
To peg their stablecoin to a dollar, most issuers say they back their coins with traditional assets that are safe and liquid. This way, whenever you want to trade your stablecoin back into a dollar, the company has the money to make the exchange. But, right now, no one can assure you that will happen. In times of stress, this uncertainty could lead to a run.
This is not hypothetical. A stablecoin run occurred in June 2021, when a sharp drop in the price of the assets used to back a stablecoin set off a negative feedback loop of stablecoin redemptions and further price declines.
The PWG report on stablecoins assesses these risks and proposes concrete solutions. And, we are now working with Congress to advance legislation to help ensure stablecoins are resilient to risks that could endanger consumers or the broader financial system. We are also working closely with our international partners to promote consistent regulation and supervision across jurisdictions.
Of course, stablecoins are just one piece of a much larger ecosystem of digital assets. Our regulatory frameworks should be designed to support responsible innovation while managing risks – especially those that could disrupt the financial system and economy. As banks and other traditional financial firms become more involved in digital asset markets, regulatory frameworks will need to appropriately reflect the risks of these new activities. And, new types of intermediaries, such as digital asset exchanges and other digital native intermediaries, should be subject to appropriate forms of oversight. 
We must also be prepared for possible changes in the structure of financial markets. For example, some have suggested that distributed ledger technology could reduce concentration in financial markets. While this could make markets less vulnerable to the failure of any particular firm, it is critical to ensure we maintain visibility into potential build-ups of systemic risk and continue to have effective tools for tamping down excesses where they arise.
President Biden’s Executive Order calls on the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify specific financial stability risks and regulatory gaps posed by various types of digital assets and make recommendations to address them. While I don’t know what the FSOC will find or conclude, there is one basic lesson that should apply…When new technologies enable new activities, products, and services, financial regulations need to adjust. But, that process should be guided by the risks associated with the services provided to households and businesses, not the underlying technology.
Wherever possible, regulation should be “tech neutral.” For example, consumers, investors, and businesses should be protected from fraud and misleading statements regardless of whether assets are stored on a balance sheet or distributed ledger. Similarly, firms that hold customer assets should be required to ensure those assets are not lost, stolen, or used without the customer’s permission. And, taxpayers should receive the same type of tax reporting on digital asset transactions that they receive for transactions in stocks and bonds, so that they have the information they need to report their income to the IRS. Under the Executive Order, we will work to make sure consumers, investors, and businesses have adequate protections from fraud and theft, privacy and data breaches, and unfair and abusive practices. Great care must also be applied to ensure innovations do not cause disparate harm to vulnerable communities or exacerbate social, racial, or economic inequities.
In many cases, regulators have authorities they can use to promote these objectives and Treasury supports those efforts. If people are breaking the law and exploiting the interests of others, they should be held accountable. To the extent there are gaps, we will make policy recommendations, including assessment of potential regulatory actions and legislative changes. Continuing to update and improve our regulatory architecture will support US economic competitiveness and reinforce leadership in the global financial system.
The principle of tech neutrality is also applicable to concerns related to tax evasion, illicit finance, and national security – topics that are particularly pertinent in the world today. It’s illegal to evade taxes, launder money, or avoid sanctions. It doesn’t matter whether you’re using checks, wires, or cryptocurrency. For nearly a decade, Treasury has been monitoring innovations in digital assets and updating our rules and guidance to clarify the application of our Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism framework to the digital asset ecosystem. We’ve also been working with our international counterparts to strengthen AML/CFT programs abroad to better protect against exploitation by illegal actors. And, we’ll continue to take action when appropriate. Just this week, Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control took strong action against the world’s largest and most prominent darknet market, Hydra, as well as Garantex, a ransomware-enabling virtual currency exchange. Under the President’s Executive Order, Treasury and colleagues across the Administration will build upon the recently published National Risk Assessments, which identify key illicit financing risks associated with digital assets. We’ll also work with our allies and partners to help ensure international frameworks, capabilities, standards, and partnerships are aligned and adequately responsive to risks.
Although innovations in computing have accelerated the pace of change, even the most foundational building blocks of our economy – including our money itself – have evolved dramatically over time.
In 1790, Secretary Alexander Hamilton bemoaned what he called the “immense disorder” of the US monetary system. At the time, Americans relied on a variety of domestic and international currencies circulating simultaneously. The proliferation of different forms of “money” made it difficult to run the economy. To help address these concerns, the Bank of the United States was formed in 1791 and issued notes that provided a relatively stable national currency. In 1792, the Coinage Act was passed, creating the US Mint and kicking off a century of debate about whether the dollar should be pegged to silver or gold. 
While these important innovations helped standardize the backing of the dollar, the Bank of the United States did not have lasting political support. By the mid-1800s, the country relied on a fragmented system of paper notes issued by private banks. New Jersey banks issued notes that were different from the ones issued in New Hampshire or New York. And, because different banks were not seen to carry the same risks, people valued the notes differently. This system of private money did function to a degree, but it made transactions expensive and inefficient, and it contributed to bank runs for many decades.
A crisis catalyzed reform. Embroiled in the Civil War, President Lincoln and Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase needed to introduce more stability to our financial system. Congress passed the National Bank Act, which allowed banks to issue national bank notes, but the banks had to be adequately supervised and the notes were required to be backed with U.S. Treasuries. This requirement ensured that a dollar in New Jersey was always as good as a dollar in New Hampshire. Later, the Federal Reserve Act further institutionalized the national objective of a uniform currency.
The development of our currency to its current form has been a dynamic process that took place over centuries. Today, monetary sovereignty and uniform currency have brought clear benefits for economic growth and stability. Our approach to digital assets must be guided by the appreciation of those benefits. 
Some have suggested a CBDC could be the next evolution in our currency. A recent report by the Federal Reserve opened a public dialogue about CBDCs and the potential benefits and risks that could be associated with issuing one in the US. The President’s Executive Order calls for us to consider this question from several perspectives. For example, what impact would a US CBDC have for implementing macro stabilization policies and private credit creation? Could it make the financial system more equitable, accessible, and inclusive? How could it be designed to manage risks associated with national security and financial crime, while including privacy protections? How might a US CBDC interact with existing national currencies, foreign CBDCs or private stablecoins?
The dollar is the mostly widely used currency for global trade and finance. It is by far the most traded currency, accounting for nearly 90% of one leg in foreign exchange transactions and over half of trading invoices. US dollar-denominated assets account for about half of cross-border bank claims and more than 40% of outstanding international debt securities.  And with the dollar’s strong trade and financial linkages—as well as strong US macroeconomic and monetary credibility—central banks have chosen to hold nearly 60% of their foreign exchange reserves in dollars.
The dollar’s international prominence is strongly supported by US institutions and policies; US economic performance; open, deep and liquid financial markets; rule of law; and a commitment to a free-floating currency. As citizens of this country, we derive significant economic and national security benefits from the unique role the dollar and US financial institutions play in the global financial system. The President’s Executive Order asks us to consider whether and how the issuance of a public CBDC would support this role. 
I don’t yet know the conclusions we will reach, but we must be clear that issuing a CBDC would likely present a major design and engineering challenge that would require years of development, not months. So, I share the President’s urgency in pulling forward research to understand the challenges and opportunities a CBDC could present to American interests.
As we consider these big choices, we must also remember that technology-driven financial innovation is inherently cross-border and requires international cooperation. We have a strong interest in ensuring that innovation does not lead to a fragmentation in international payment architectures and that the development of digital asset technologies is consistent with our values and laws. Many of the most groundbreaking innovations in our history have involved all of us: policymakers and businesspeople, advocates, scholars, inventors, and citizens. Think of the development of the national highway system, the space race, the creation of the internet, or the ongoing revolution in biotechnology. All of these innovations have transformed the way we live our lives.
People have a wide range of views when it comes to digital assets. On one hand, some proponents speak as if the technology is so radically and beneficially transformative that the government should step back completely and let innovation take its course. On the other hand, skeptics see limited, if any, value in this technology and associated products and advocate that the government take a much more restrictive approach. Such divergence of perspectives has often been associated with new and transformative technologies.
In my view, the government’s role should be to ensure responsible innovation – innovation that works for all Americans, protects our national security interests and our planet, and contributes to our economic competitiveness and growth. Such responsible innovation should reflect thoughtful public-private dialogue and take account of the many lessons we’ve learned throughout our financial history. "
311,,"March 28, 2022","WASHINGTON -- The Biden-Harris Administration today submitted to Congress the President’s Budget for FY 2023 and Treasury published its Strategic Plan for FY 2022-2026. The President’s Budget details his vision to expand on the historic progress our country has made over the last year and deliver the agenda he laid out in his State of the Union address—to build a better America, reduce the deficit, lower costs for families, and grow the economy from the bottom up and middle out.  “President Biden’s Fiscal Year 2023 Budget aspires to improve the livelihoods of working families and keep our economy globally competitive and includes investments that will help achieve both those goals,” U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen said. “Last year, we experienced a rapid recovery with historic job creation and economic growth. This economic rebound allows us to look beyond the pandemic-induced crisis and provide a roadmap to address future challenges: creating a tax system that is fair to working families, expanding access to capital in disadvantaged communities, and safeguarding the financial system. In addition to the Budget, Treasury’s newly released Strategic Plan outlines the Department’s long-term goals to promote equitable economic growth, enhance national security, protect financial stability and resiliency, combat climate change, and modernize Treasury operations.”The Budget makes critical investments in the American people that will help lay a stronger foundation for shared growth and prosperity for generations to come, aligning resources to implement the goals in the Treasury Strategic Plan.

She was the first and only woman in many of the rooms where decisions were made. But she wasn’t the last. And I think that’s a credit to Madeleine’s candor, preparedness, and deep expertise, which was invaluable to leaders around the world. She will be greatly missed.

313,,"March 11, 2022","I want to extend my sincerest thanks to Mi Casa Resource Center for having us here today. I just spoke with participants in the small business and workforce programs and I am very impressed with their work. I want to thank Angeles Ortega, Mi Casa’s CEO for hosting us.  And my thanks to Governor Polis, Lieutenant Governor Primavera, and Deputy Mayor Hanlon, and Council Woman Jamie Torres for being here. I want to thank the Second Gentleman for joining me in Denver.  And, I also want to thank Senators Bennett and Hickenlooper, Congresswoman Degette and Congressmen Perlmutter, Crow, and Neguse for all they have done for Colorado and the country in passing ARP.While it is not the focus of my remarks today, I wanted to start out by saying that my thoughts continue to be with the people of Ukraine as they fight back against an unprovoked invasion of their homeland. The United States and our partners and allies have already leveled significant costs on the Russian economy and President Putin, including more today, and we will continue to do so if he furthers his invasion. This continues to be a top priority for President Biden and our entire Administration.Almost exactly a year ago, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan. But, to tell the story of our recovery, it’s worth winding the clock back a little bit further. Fifty days prior to the signing of ARP, I was at the Capitol to watch President Biden and Vice President Harris take the Oath of Office. It was a historic day, but it was also an uncertain one.  
The country was in its worst wave of COVID deaths. Vaccines had yet to become widely available. More Americans were applying for unemployment insurance each week than during the worst week of the Great Recession. When the President signed the American Rescue Plan into law two months later, there was still a sense of unease about the future. While we had made progress – millions more were vaccinated – we didn’t know what was to come, and it felt entirely possible that March 2022 would look a lot like March 2021. Of course, that never materialized. For one, look around: We are here, in person. But it’s also the strength of our economy, which bears little resemblance to the dark opening days of the pandemic. Last year, our economy grew at its fastest rate in 40 years. Unemployment has fallen to 3.8%.  It’s easy to think of this as inevitable, that we were assured to have a strong labor market and a stable recovery. But there is a very real counterfactual where any of the numerous challenges we have faced could have stalled our economy. Delta could have sent more kids home from school. We could’ve had a sky-high unemployment rate that Omicron sent higher. Foreclosures and evictions could have been widespread. But we now know that this didn’t happen – and we know why. There are many reasons, of course, but I think one of the undeniable ones – one of the most important ones – is the American Rescue Plan. The plan provided a comprehensive response to a once-in-a-generation pandemic by investing in vaccines and public health infrastructure, putting money in the pockets of families, and supporting communities and small businesses. The full suite of programs in the American Rescue Plan – or ARP – didn’t just protect us from the problems we had encountered; it prepared us for what we didn’t know was coming. In some ways, the ARP acted like a vaccine for the American economy, ensuring that we were inoculated from the possibility of new variants or unforeseen circumstances. When we passed the ARP, we did not know which challenges would come, but we did know that new challenges would come. We designed the package first and foremost so different communities with different needs could meet the different challenges they would face. The core of that was the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program, which helped communities make it to the other side of the pandemic. States and localities used the funding to tackle the public health challenge of the pandemic headfirst. Governments nationwide reported nearly 2,000 distinct projects to fight COVID-19 through vaccinations, testing, surge capacity at hospitals, nursing home protections, additional PPE, and many other efforts. And that funding did much more than just respond to the immediate health impacts of the pandemic. Over 740,000 essential workers – like teachers, nurses, police officers and grocery workers – have received premium pay or bonus pay on top of their regular wages. Premium pay offers these workers extra compensation to recognize their risk and sacrifice during the pandemic. Facing the possibility of tax collections shrinking by 12%, roughly double the hit caused by the Great Recession, city department heads were asked to find 7.5% worth of cuts in their budgets. Public employees – including the mayor – were furloughed for eight days to save funds. 
There was a real possibility that the history of 2008 – where state government employment didn’t recover for a decade – would repeat itself.But we know that didn’t happen. Thanks to $67 million in public sector capacity investments, Denver was able to rehire 265 city staff positions left vacant because of pandemic-related cuts. The city is returning this year to 2020 spending levels, which then, Chief Financial Officer Brendan Hanlon said was in part due to federal financial support. Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper, Governor Polis, Mayor Hancock, and the Colorado congressional delegation have been crucial parts of building that support. The ARP – and specifically the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds – allowed places like Denver to help fill the gaps, nurse people back to health, and keep workers on the job. If you got sick or needed to quarantine, the ARP offered tax credits to help employers cover paid leave. Or, if you owned a small business, you were eligible for relief to keep employees on payroll.
The programs, in their totality, allowed Colorado and the country to recover. Think of Pueblo, Colorado, which used $280,000 to increase housing stability for homeless and low-income individuals. Or Fort Collins, which allocated $400,000 for a multicultural business and entrepreneur center to address gaps in the current business support system that affect small businesses owned by entrepreneurs of color, women, and low-income individuals.It is undeniably true that communities in Denver and across Colorado – and indeed, the entire country – are better off today than we would be without the American Rescue Plan. But what’s also true is that we will be better off tomorrow, and years to come, because of this legislation.
We learned some difficult lessons from prior recessions, and one of the most important ones was that economic scarring – Which I’d define as prolonged, negative impacts owing to a recession – can have severe and long-lasting impacts on broad swaths of people. We saw this in the last recession, when millions of Americans struggled with long-term unemployment, housing instability, financial insecurity, and diminished access to nutrition support and health care. Avoiding these harmful outcomes was a core aspiration of the legislation. The ARP, for example, expanded Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit to put additional money in families’ pockets to keep their financial lives intact. The Emergency Rental Assistance played a key role in preventing a tsunami of evictions, which disrupts people’s ability to keep or find work and uproots children from schools. Expanded nutrition support kept rising rates of food insecurity at bay, and more generous subsidies for health insurance helped Americans to afford health care.  Ultimately, one of the guiding principles was to preserve the existing economy – whether we’re talking about families, small businesses, or state and local governments – so that we hit the ground running as we emerged from the pandemic, while foregoing all of the scarring from prior recessions. Just think of what’s happened here in Denver. Places like where we are today- the Mi Casa Resource Center - are supporting small businesses thanks to ARP funds received from the City of Denver’s Economic Development and Opportunity Department. Beyond that: the City of Denver and the State of Colorado have used these recovery funds to provide $18 million to recruit, retain, and train a behavioral health workforce, fund a Child Tax Credit/Earned Income Tax Credit outreach arm of your Preventive Services Division, finance the development and preservation of affordable housing units, and invest $25 million in reskilling, upskilling, and next-skilling workers whose jobs may have been affected by the pandemic. This is what economic policymaking is about: Making sure people have all the tools at their disposal to succeed. And, when individuals are supported, communities are supported, and the country is better off. The strength of our economy also allows us to better respond to any crises that come our way—whether those crises are an invasion of Ukraine by Russia or some other unforeseen circumstance. Our world is interconnected, and our ambition to ensure that Russia pays a high price for its unprovoked invasion has already impacted us at home. America is better able to handle these turbulent times because our economy is historically strong, and the American economy is historically strong because of the ARP and the resiliency of the American people."

This facility began minting coins a little over a century later and has been a backbone of the Mint’s production ever since. The work each of you do is crucial. And despite the pandemic and the related currency shortage, you all have continued to show up – through your critical work here, you’ve helped keep our nation’s economy running.  March, of course, is also Women’s History Month. And I was very grateful that the Mint honored this in a historic way by the placing of Maya Angelou on the quarter. In the 232 years since the Treasury Department’s founding, we’ve chosen people to appear on our currency because their ideas have been central to how we think about running an economy. Many of these people – and they’ve almost exclusively been men – have made incredible contributions to this country – people like Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Thomas JeffersonYet something has been missing from this body of ideas: The remarkable achievements of women leaders, scholars, poets, and entrepreneurs who we have not honored. In choosing Maya Angelou – and the other women featured through the American Women Quarters program – we are not only lifting up these incredible individuals, we are making a statement about how our society has progressed and about what we value.Making this happen wasn’t easy. I know that the American Women Quarters are produced here in Denver and that behind each coin are so many difficult decisions. There are a lot of steps to turn a concept into reality – from the image selection, to the design, to the production, to the distribution. I’m grateful to each of you for being such effective partners in that work. Whether it is your work distributing coins, designing medals, producing bullion coins, or any of the other amazing things the Mint does, thank you for your efforts.And I’m excited to work with Deputy Director Gibson—and all of you—to make the Mint even stronger in the coming months. With all of the important work you do to make our country a better and more inclusive place, I know that there is still work to be done to make the Mint a more equitable institution. "
315,,"March 9, 2022","Thank you all for joining us. This is an important week. As you know, Friday marks the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing the American Rescue Plan into law.This bill has loosened the pandemic’s grip on our country in countless ways over the past year. Today, I wanted to take a moment and look back at one of the bill’s more significant programs – the State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund – and talk about what it’s done. As this group knows better than anyone, the first year of the pandemic decimated government budgets, forcing states and communities to layoff or furlough a collective 1.3 million workers.How is a city supposed to weather a pandemic if it can’t keep on its first responders? How are you supposed to bring kids back to school if you are facing the prospect of laying off teachers?  Those are the questions we haven’t had to answer this past year – or at least have had to answer much less frequently – because of the ARP.The bill kept our society’s everyday institutions working. Hawaii, for instance, had planned to furlough 10,000 employees, but on the day President Biden signed the Rescue Plan into law they cancelled the layoffs.Nor did the program only rehire public workers. Over the past year, more than 740,000 essential workers – teachers, nurses, police officers and grocery clerks – have received bonus pay on top of their regular wages. They deserve to be compensated for keeping society running during the pandemic, and they are. In some ways, the ARP also acted like a vaccine for the American economy, protecting our recovery from the possibility of new variants, like Omicron and Delta.  The pandemic produced a highly unusual economic crisis – one tied not to the movements of markets but to the spread and evolution of microbes. It hit different places in different ways at different times. The state and local fund was designed with that in mind, too.Rather than one burst of money that could only be spent in certain ways, it called for sustained and flexible funding. We wanted local officials to be able to channel resources to wherever the problems were as they arose. With Omicron and Delta, that meant public health. Local governments funded nearly 2,000 distinct projects with state and local money to fight COVID-19. They’ve bought PPE, conducted immunization campaigns, expanded testing, protected nursing homes, and many other efforts.But it’s been broader, like on housing. Last summer, many of the mayors here saw that two trends were colliding: the spread of new variants and the expiration of the nation’s eviction moratorium. There was a risk that people were going to lose the roofs over their heads, something that would not only complicate our efforts to stop the spread but also complicate people’s lives for years to come.  That’s why many communities used state & local funding to supplement emergency rental assistance.  Today, eviction filings have remained well below their pre-pandemic levels in large part because of those decisions. In fact, according to a new analysis by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab published today, millions of renters avoided the threat of eviction last year due to the federal government’s serious and unprecedented interventions, in significant part through the American Rescue Plan.Still, there’s a good argument that without the American Rescue Plan in general – and the State & Local Recovery Fund in particular – our economy would’ve been much weaker for much longer. And it might’ve stayed that way for some time to come. That was the lesson of 2008. During the Great Recession, when cities and states were facing similar revenue shortfalls, the federal government didn’t provide enough aid to close the gap. It was a profound error. Cities had to slash spending, and that undermined the broader recovery. One study concludes that for every $1 local governments cut in spending during a recession, there is a corresponding drop in GDP of more than $1 – and possibly as much as $3. After 2008, state government employment didn’t recover from the Great Recession until 2019.We are no longer in the grips of this pandemic. We have helped millions of families and businesses escape from COVID with their finances intact. That was never a sure thing. It’s due, in large part, to the bill we celebrate this week. "
316,,"March 9, 2022","""President Biden’s historic executive order calls for a coordinated and comprehensive approach to digital asset policy.  This approach will support responsible innovation that could result in substantial benefits for the nation, consumers, and businesses.  It will also address risks related to illicit finance, protecting consumers and investors, and preventing threats to the financial system and broader economy.Under the executive order, Treasury will partner with interagency colleagues to produce a report on the future of money and payment systems. We’ll also convene the Financial Stability Oversight Council to evaluate the potential financial stability risks of digital assets and assess whether appropriate safeguards are in place. And, because the questions raised by digital assets often have important cross-border dimensions, we’ll work with our international partners to promote robust standards and a level playing field.This work will complement ongoing efforts by Treasury. Already, the Department has worked with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, the FDIC, and OCC to study one particular kind of digital asset – stablecoins– and to make recommendations. Under the executive order, Treasury and interagency partners will build upon the recently published National Risk Assessments, which identify key illicit financing risks associated with digital assets. As we take on this important work, we’ll be guided by consumer and investor protection groups, market participants, and other leading experts.  Treasury will work to promote a fairer, more inclusive, and more efficient financial system, while building on our ongoing work to counter illicit finance, and prevent risks to financial stability and national security."""
317,,"March 4, 2022","Let me start by thanking the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, and especially Director Mark Duggan, for inviting me to participate in today’s event. SIEPR has an impressive track record of supporting high-quality, impactful economic policy research, and it is an honor to be part of this organization’s Economic Summit. It is a special privilege, too, to follow these remarks with a discussion with Professor John Shoven, whom I am fortunate to have known for over half a century.While it is not the topic of my remarks today, I wanted to start out by just saying my thoughts continue to be with the people of Ukraine as they fight back against an unprovoked invasion of their homeland. The United States and our partners and allies have already leveled significant costs to the Russian economy and President Putin, and we will continue to do so if he furthers his invasion. I’m sure we may discuss this more in our conversation following my remarks, but this continues to be a top priority for President Biden and the entire Administration.My remarks today will focus on economic disparities across communities and racial groups. I’ll argue that targeted investments to address these disparities can not only mitigate growing inequality, but also propel sustainable macroeconomic growth.My remarks will briefly document the extent of the dispersion across communities and race, before turning to a strategy I’ve termed “Modern Supply Side Economics” to frame how key aspects of the President’s economic agenda can boost growth while addressing such inequality.While the relevant definition of “place” can depend on context—sometimes it can be a city, other times it’s a neighborhood, or even a single building—the residents and workers who populate these places endure wide variation in resources, opportunities, and standards of living.Consider the gap in social and economic metrics between counties in the top and bottom quintiles, as calculated by economists Ryan Nunn and Jay Shambaugh. Looking across select years over the past two decades, they find that the median household income is just $40,300 for the bottom quintile, compared to $83,000 for the top.The poverty rate was 22.7% for the bottom quintile, but only 8.1% for the top. Housing vacancy rates were 21.7% in the worst-performing quintile, but only 5.2% in the best. Others have found similar divergences in rates of opioid addiction, childhood poverty, and incarceration, to name a few.Two specific metrics merit special mention given their outsized impact on the potential output of a local economy. One is educational attainment, which is a strong predictor of economic and social wellbeing across U.S. counties. Increases in educational attainment can explain roughly 11% to 20% of U.S. productivity growth in recent decades, according to a U.S. Department of Education report that examined the link between education and economic productivity.As economist Tim Bartik points out, labor force participation varies substantially across metro areas, with a participation gap of 9 percentage points between the 10th and 90th percentiles of the employment rate distribution – roughly equivalent to the difference between the 1st and 22nd place among OECD countries.What emerges from these statistics is a portrait of an economy fractured by zip code, where economic resources are increasingly concentrated in the best-endowed areas, while the rest of the economy languishes—creating persistent income disparities.One possibility is that it reflects the economics of agglomeration. The notion of agglomeration is that economic activity naturally clusters in close proximity due to transaction costs associated with distance and the spillover benefits of closeness. Yet – variation across places cannot be explained solely by agglomeration. And even if it could, that would not excuse policymakers from seeking reforms to spread economic gains more broadly across the American landscape.Just as we see variations in economic resources and outcomes across America’s places, there are also persistent disparities across the racial spectrum. And of course, it is critical to note that place and race are deeply interconnected in the United States, due in large part to decades of harmful policies designed to maintain residential segregation between races.Disparities by race rival disparities across place. In terms of education and wages, for example, Black and Hispanic workers lag behind their white counterparts on virtually every metric. The gap begins early in a person’s life, with white students’ math skills at kindergarten entry 0.5 standard deviations higher than Black students’ and 0.7 standard deviation higher than Hispanic students’ on average.These disparities in educational attainment continue through higher education, with 35% of white adults earning a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to just 21% of Black adults and 15% of Hispanic adults. Large educational disparities, coupled with racial discrimination in the labor market and other factors, lead to marked variation in wages and lifetime earning potential. By the time workers have reached their peak earning years, the average wage of Black and Hispanic workers is 75% that of whites.Health disparities, for example, also begin early in life, and persist over the typical individual’s lifespan. Black and Hispanic Americans face higher rates of child abuse, lead exposure, obesity in childhood, and chronic illness in adulthood, and endure more restricted access to quality medical care.Disparities across people and places coexist with a macroeconomy that currently suffers from acute long-term growth challenges, despite strong short-term growth. Under President Biden’s leadership, the U.S. economy has grown rapidly during the recovery from the pandemic, with GDP growing last year at the most rapid rate in 40 years.But forecasters uniformly agree that growth over the next several decades will be sluggish, limited by slow productivity growth and an aging population that restricts growth in labor supply.These facts suggest the need for a policy approach that fosters greater equity across places and races while, at the same time, propelling faster aggregate growth.Modern Supply Side Economics aims to expand our nation’s economic potential through productivity-enhancing investments paired with policies to boost labor supply. In terms of the aggregate production function, this approach raises labor productivity through deeper physical capital—both public and private; higher human capital; and advances in science and technology.In addition, tax-based incentives and pro-family labor policies are designed to increase labor force participation. Traditional supply side economics, in contrast, focuses largely on augmenting the stock of private capital through policies that lower the user cost of capital—mainly through tax cuts on investment.In addition to its focus on this broader set of factors of production, Modern Supply Side Economics is concerned with the distribution of investments across sectors, people, and places.Under the traditional approach, tax cuts that lower the user cost of capital typically initially benefit capital owners; the benefits are then spread more broadly if—and this is a contentious if—those cuts lead to broader investment.This approach, however, can exacerbate long-standing disparities across place and race because the initial benefits typically accrue to capital owners—a small and highly concentrated group.Then, if cuts in capital taxation do not promote broader investment in disadvantaged areas or in projects that benefit households of color, the traditional approach tends to worsen preexisting inequities.The modern supply side strategy, by contrast, is focused on allocating investments in a more systematic and equitable way—ensuring that disadvantaged communities and racial groups receive an adequate share of investments in both physical and human capital. Indeed, it is an explicit feature of this approach that individuals and areas that have been subject to the underinvestment I described receive outsized consideration. Such an approach yields larger aggregate gains under the basic economic premise that returns to investment exhibit diminishing returns. In the context of investments in people, directing public resources to children and to workers who have received less education and training can yield the largest bang for the buck—and a return that can last decades.One example of the promise of the modern approach can be seen through initiatives that remove lead from public water systems—a signature investment by the Biden-Harris Administration that was included in the Bipartisan Infrastructure bill.As research by economist Janet Currie and others has shown, lead exposure can cause cognitive impairment in children, including significantly lower math and reading comprehension scores—with children of color and families in disadvantaged communities more likely to experience exposure. While traditional supply side economics would be unlikely to address this concern, the modern approach recognizes the potential productivity boost that comes with better academic proficiency owing to cleaner water.In addition to this commitment to install lead-free pipes nationwide, the President’s economic agenda includes an array of ambitious proposals designed to expand the productive capacity of economy while promoting more inclusive growth.For example, the agenda focuses on boosting labor force participation by raising effective wages and mitigating barriers to employment. In particular, it proposes an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit—which is projected to raise the after-tax wages for 17 million workers—along with family-friendly proposals, such as tax credits and subsidies to make childcare affordable for low- and middle-income households; paid leave for workers; and universal pre-k education for three- and four-year old children. It also proposes an ambitious program to improve public transit systems.A key element of the President’s agenda is to raise worker productivity through a collection of human-capital initiatives that would expand access to early child education, make college more affordable, strengthen worker training, and achieve universal broadband access. All told, these investments represent one of the most ambitious expansions in training and education in our nation’s history—an investment program that would revitalize the preparedness of our nation’s workforce.The Administration has also made access to capital for disadvantaged communities a key component of its economic strategy. This includes the State Small Business Credit Initiative to generate capital for small business lending and investment, unprecedented expansions in investments for community and economic development programs, and a Green Energy Accelerator that would devote 40% of its resources to disadvantaged communities.A critical component of the Biden agenda involves the targeting of investments to mitigate place- and race-based inequities. A sizable share of the President’s child-care reform agenda flows through state programs to subsidize care for low-income families. Many of the President’s housing reforms are directed at disadvantaged communities with deteriorating housing stocks or a dearth of affordable homes. Historically Black Colleges and Universities also receive billions in support through the President’s agenda.This targeting has two notable impacts. The first is that it promises to mitigate place- and race-based disparities that have plagued our economy for far too long.The economics literature shows these impacts could be substantial. Take, for example, the proposed expansion in the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC, for childless adults. This expansion is means-tested and thus highly progressive across the income distribution. The EITC, however, also has outsized impacts for racial minorities, owing to the relatively high prevalence of low-income Black households and the Credit’s ability to impact Black workers’ labor market participation. Looking at the impact of the EITC since its inception, recent research by Bradley Hardy, Charles Hoyakem, and James Ziliak found that the EITC significantly closed racial income disparities across much of the income distribution.A second potential impact of targeting is its potential to meaningfully boost aggregate economic growth. For example, Mary Daly and co-authors simulate the economic production surrendered to racial inequity over the past three decades and find that more equitable education and labor market inclusion would annually add 760 billion to the economy. And while it would be unreasonable to suggest that any single reform package would fully equalize labor market outcomes for white and non-white workers, this calculation is suggestive of meaningful gains.Further evidence of the growth-boosting potential of targeted investments to reduce place and race-based inequality comes in a recent paper by Chang-Tai Hsieh, Erik Hurst, Pete Klenow, and Chad Jones. These researchers estimate that between 20% to 40% of gains in economic output between 1960 and 2010 can be explained by inclusion of women and racial minorities in highly skilled occupations, such as the rising share of non-white doctors.In conclusion, I’ll note that the link between greater equity and stronger growth is one of the reasons the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic agenda embraces racial equity as a core component.Of course, there is no greater American ideal than providing equal opportunity regardless of race; this moral imperative is given voice in the Declaration of Independence and protected in the Constitution. But as a purely economic matter, righting inequities is also one of the most promising growth strategies we have in our toolbox."
318,,"March 2, 2022","Following the President’s first State of the Union, Secretary Yellen traveled to Chicago, Illinois to highlight the Biden Administration’s economic agenda and the continued efforts to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked invasion in Ukraine. The Secretary delivered remarks at the University of Illinois Chicago’s Innovation Center following a tour of the facility with Illinois Governor J. B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot.Thank you to the University of Illinois at Chicago’s Innovation Lab for hosting us and to Governor Pritzker and Mayor Lightfoot for welcoming me to the wonderful city of Chicago.I want to begin by saying my thoughts are with the people of Ukraine, who continue to exemplify exceptional bravery as they face an unprovoked attack on their sovereign territory. Over the last week, Ukrainians of all backgrounds and circumstances have come together to protect homes and defend their democratic principles.You have also seen in the last week, an unprecedented and unified response by countries on nearly every continent, to Russia’s invasion. Thanks to the months-long diplomatic effort by President Biden, the global community has never been more aligned and our relationships with our allies have never been stronger.The Treasury Department and finance ministries around the world together have isolated the Russian economy and made it harder to finance Putin’s war of choice. Eighty percent of its banking assets are now under Treasury restrictions, and between Sunday and Monday morning, we, along with our allies, immobilized half the assets in Russia’s central bank. Russia is increasingly on an economic island.We have also made it a priority to go after oligarchs or Russian elites who are key to President Putin’s corrupt power. We have sanctioned many of these individuals and we are working with justice department colleagues and our international allies to uncover, freeze, and seize their wealth around the world.If President Putin continues this unprovoked invasion, President Biden and our allies and partners around the world will remain steadfast in our commitment to continue to impose severe consequences against Russia and hold President Putin accountable for his illegal and amoral actions.As President Biden conveyed in last night’s State of the Union Address, American economic policymaking is powerful tool in service of democracy. In recent days, we’ve used it to weaken Russia. I’m proud of the role the Treasury Department has played – and will continue to play – in these efforts.But as we use economic policy to protect democracy abroad, it is an equally powerful to strengthen America at home. The past year has demonstrated the power of strong fiscal policy to keep our economy afloat during the depths of a crisis and strengthen the financial situations of millions of working families around the country.It’s worth remembering where the country was the day President Biden took office. It was the height of the pandemic and a moment of real jeopardy for our economy. More Americans were applying for unemployment insurance than during the worst week of the Great Recession. Millions of people said they didn’t have enough food to eat, and some economists were making dire predictions – that the pandemic would plunge our economy further into recession, with many more jobs lost.Of course, such predictions never materialized. In fact, if somehow you transported a group of economists – including me – from that moment to today… and just showed us the current topline data… we would be quite pleased. By most traditional metrics, the pace of the U.S.’s current recovery has exceeded even the most optimistic expectations.  Last year our economy grew at its fastest rate in 40 years.  Unemployment is now at 3.9 percent – the sharpest one-year drop in the rate ever. Household finances are healthy, and our economy appears to be poised for further growth.We’ve achieved all this despite a new wave of the pandemic, which is important to mention because there’s a very real counterfactual where Omicron did derail our recovery; a scenario where the new variant hurdled our economy backwards towards its state on Inauguration Day 2021.There are a variety of reasons that didn’t happen, but among the most important is the American Rescue Plan, which President Biden signed into law, almost exactly a year ago. The law helped distribute hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine, but it also acted like a vaccine for the economy, protecting our recovery from the possibility of new variants.The Rescue Plan gave people money to weather Omicron and Delta, and it injected funding into cities and states, so that they could keep essential workers on the payroll and help businesses stay afloat.  Illinois used about $150 million in rescue funding to keep more than 4,100 small businesses open – everything from salons to laundromats to restaurants, including the owner of Sip & Savor, who credits the funding with allowing him to continue serving Chicago’s Bronzeville community.  Indeed, when Omicron started spreading around our cities, it did not find them broke and broken; it found them much in a stronger place to weather new waves. President Biden’s first year in office was laser-focused on protecting our recovery from the pandemic. But as we’re emerging, now is the time to pivot towards creating an economy for the future. Not simply to fight fires and resolve crises, but to build a better country. We now have a window to start building a stronger post-COVID America.“How do we do that?” is the central question the President addressed last night, and the answer begins with increasing the productive capacity of our economy – while also building a more inclusive economy, where everyone has a real shot at success.As the President said last night, we need new economic thinking, and our approach is what I’ve called “modern supply side economics.” It’s an economic policy that aims to expand our nation’s economic potential through productivity-enhancing investments along with policies to encourage more people to join the labor market. To make our economy more productive and to add more workers, Modern Supply Side Economics makes targeted public investments in area like education and infrastructure, directs resources to underserved communities and workers, and introduces incentives for people to enter workforce. It is a sharp contrast to traditional supply side economics we’ve seen, which relies on deregulation and tax cuts for investors to power purported growth.And this new economic thinking also ensures we address threats to our economic growth—like climate change. And it embraces targeted investments in communities that have long-suffered from underinvestment while addressing racial inequities that have plagued our economy for too long.Last night, the President talked about some of the ways we can do this: like ensuring no family pays more than 7% of their income for the care of young children, improving our infrastructure through the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure bill that benefits American families, workers, and businesses alike, and finally enacting paid family and medical leave.And importantly, the President made it clear that we can do all of this in a fiscally responsible way. We don’t have to choose between a growing economy and a fair tax code that asks the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share. We can and must do both. As the President said last night, this is the way to build a better America where as he says, we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out, instead of the top down. We know this has been a difficult last few years for the American people but I am optimistic about our economic future. The American Rescue Plan turned us around from the path of recession to the path of recovery. And the bipartisan infrastructure law will start making the investments that will increase productivity. I’m confident if we take additional steps to support workers and families, we will be able to boost long-term growth that is equitable, sustained, and move decisively toward a more prosperous future."
319,,"March 1, 2022","WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement today following her participation in a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on the current situation in Ukraine and actions taken in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“Along with my G7 partners, this morning I spoke with the Minister of Finance of Ukraine, Sergii Marchenko. I denounce in the strongest terms Russia’s illegal, brutal invasion of Ukraine. The people of Ukraine continue to exemplify exceptional bravery as they face an unprovoked attack on their sovereign territory. The United States wholeheartedly supports Ukraine and will continue to stand by the people of Ukraine in their fight for their country and our shared democratic ideals. We are working closely with allies to mobilize significant international support for Ukraine, as the country grapples with a fundamental disruption of its economy, an attack on its independence, and a humanitarian crisis.Russia’s unjustified invasion of Ukraine represents an assault on the fundamental norms and laws that underpin the international order. The United States, along with our key partners and allies around the globe, have imposed unprecedented economic pressure measures on Russia in response. Our collective efforts have resulted in the world’s major financial and economic centers acting in concert to sever Vladimir Putin’s access to the international economy, including international capital. We expect these efforts to have a debilitating impact on Russia’s economy and hamstring the Russian government’s ability to fund its invasion. Most recently, we and our G7 partners worked to effectively immobilize key assets held by the Central Bank of Russia, a major step that already has had a strong impact on Russia, visible in the financial market reactions. We continue to endorse, in coordination with our partners and allies, removing from SWIFT key Russian financial institutions. In addition, we will convene an international Task Force with our justice ministries to freeze and seize the assets of key Russian elites, which will inflict financial pain on the powerful individuals surrounding Putin and make clear that no one is beyond our collective reach. Finally, we will continue to coordinate closely with G7 partners and others on our response, and we stand ready to impose further financial pressure, as necessary.The United States remains steadfast in its commitment to hold Russia accountable for its illegal and immoral actions. I am personally determined to protect our democratic values and international norms around the globe that have kept us safe and driven global growth and prosperity for decades.”"

Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
321,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
322,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
323,,"November 21, 2023",
324,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
325,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

326,,"February 17, 2022","Thank you to our Indonesian hosts for arranging this seminar to advance our joint efforts to strengthen the global health architecture.  We all are aware of the terrible human and economic toll that the pandemic has wrought.  And we are not yet on the other side of this pandemic.The pandemic has demonstrated that we must work collectively to address health threats, or no country will be safe.  The fates of our people—and economies—are intertwined.We have also now clearly seen that public health is a critical pillar of the economy.  We may have taken this for granted as life expectancies rose and medical advances were made over the past decades.  But the pandemic reduced life expectancy for many countries across the globe, and in some—like my own—for the first time since World War II.  We must move forward to build a stronger global health architecture.We have work to do to both complete the current recovery and invest in the resilience of the global health infrastructure.  Doing so will set the global economy on a path toward more enduring growth and prosperity and will have us better prepared for the next health shock.Our most immediate goal is to complete what we have already started:  we must end this pandemic as a matter of utmost urgency.  We must and can ensure that every country has the access, the means, and the capacity to vaccinate their populations.We need strong coordination among national governments, multilateral institutions, and bilateral partners so that vaccine supplies quickly get to where they are needed and, once they are there, that the capabilities and resources are in place to get vaccines into arms.The Multilateral Leaders Task Force has a critical role here.  The Task Force has compiled data on vaccination gaps.  This is helpful, but only a first step.  Now we need to fill the gaps identified by the data as well as identify and overcome the obstacles to doing so.  The Task Force should articulate clear and actionable steps to improve vaccine deployment so that all partners—national governments, multilateral institutions, and bilateral agencies—know what they need to do to quickly turn vaccines into vaccinations.In this regard, we ask the Task Force to deliver a report to health and finance ministers that provides a detailed, country-by-country assessment of the work done so far by all to advance both vaccine supply and vaccination.  The report should identify successes, challenges, and proposed remedies to those challenges to meet vaccination targets.  We welcome the World Bank’s agreement to convene a High‑Level Meeting on Vaccine Deployment during the Spring Meetings, so that we advance this initiative with more clarity about the next required actions. While vaccines are the focus, the COVID response is also about increasing the availability of diagnostics, therapeutics, and personal protective equipment.The international community has stepped up to address COVID-19.  The United States is the largest contributor to ACT‑A, providing more than $6 billion in financing—and hundreds of millions of vaccine donations.  But our collective efforts have not been enough.  We urge all G20 partners to contribute to this collective effort to end the pandemic.Beyond the immediate response, we must come together to make sure we are much better prepared next time. We know that this will not be the last pandemic.  We must act urgently to strengthen the global health architecture so that we have the tools to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future health crises.To be better prepared, we need to create a forum for strong health and finance collaboration, which was missing before COVID-19.  The G20 Finance‑Health Task Force is a good starting point to explore more systematic and formal cooperation.Through this forum, finance and health ministries from around the world can come together to discuss issues related to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response.  This will be critical in detecting and containing the next deadly pathogen, so that it doesn’t spread to become a regional or global pandemic, devastating our people and our economies.  This forum will also better synchronize health policy prioritization and finance decisions, yielding much greater results than our efforts before COVID‑19.  It will also bring in voices from regional groups to incorporate diverse and often underrepresented perspectives to the global conversation. To complement our stronger coordination, we must also focus on mobilizing the funding needed to address gaps in the system.  We have existing tools, and the World Bank and WHO will soon report to the G20 on the financing gaps in the current health architecture.  But experts have already been loud and clear that gaps exist, and that the financing needs are undeniable.  Estimates of the need run to $75 billion over the next five years.  However, this is far less than the economic cost of the current pandemic.We support strengthening existing initiatives, like those of the multilateral development banks, and the creation of the new IMF Resilience and Sustainability Trust.  But these initiatives are not suited to all situations, and critical gaps will remain.Last year, the G20 High Level Independent Panel recommended this type of fund to channel the large amount of investment needed to reduce global vulnerabilities to future pandemics.  I know some have reservations about this proposal, so let me describe how I see it coming together.First, the purpose of the Fund is to make immediate investments to prevent and prepare for future health crises.  We don’t see this as a pool of money that sits idly waiting to respond to the next pandemic.  Rather, it will be used in the near term to incentivize countries to make investments to fill existing gaps in their ability—and our collective capacity—to prevent and prepare for the next crisis, as part of overall health system strengthening.  For example, the Fund could help countries invest in disease detection and surveillance systems, research laboratories, or strengthen their healthcare workforces.Second, the Fund will not create a new multilateral organization that attempts to execute projects independently.  Instead, it will be a new financing tool to flexibly channel and incentivize funding for investments in pandemic preparedness at the country, regional, and global levels through existing health and financial institutions. For example, the Fund may channel funds through World Bank or WHO projects that are specifically geared toward pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response efforts.The Fund’s flexibility will also allow the possibility of mobilizing resources from non-government sources for pandemic preparedness beyond what the current architecture supports.And finally, I want to make clear that the Fund should be designed to be additional; it should not draw resources away from separate efforts to strengthen the WHO.  We agree with other G20 members that we must commit the necessary resources to strengthen the WHO and the existing global health institutions. It is our job now to identify significant financing to address the gaps in the current system—we are finance ministers after all.  The World Bank’s gaps analysis and work of the Finance-Health Task Force can help inform the prioritization of investments that the Fund will eventually make.  And we should begin our work now to set up this Fund so that it is ready to go as soon as possible. I urge all G20 members to join in the effort to develop this financial intermediary fund in the coming months.  While contributions will be voluntary, those that are able to do so should step up to finance these investments in our global health security.  While the human and economic trauma of the pandemic is fresh in our minds, we have a political window to act to address the deficiencies in our global health architecture, made all too apparent by the current crisis.  We all share this interest, and the cost of not doing so could be devastating."
327,,"February 8, 2022","Thank you, Gene, and thank you all for coming – and, more importantly, thank you for the work you’re doing to make sure these tax credits actually reach the people they’re intended to help. I especially want to thank Vice President Harris. We would not be here today without her work.You know, there’s a very famous story about Harry Truman. You’ve probably heard it. He once asked to be sent to a one-armed economist. He didn’t like the way his current economic counselors were advising him, always saying “on the one hand,” before making a caveat: “but on the other…” Truman didn’t like the equivocation.Well, I tell this story because had Harry Truman decided to expand the CTC and the EITC, he would’ve been quite pleased with his advisors. This is an issue where there actually are many “one-armed economists” so to speak. There is very little equivocation that these policies lift up the lives of millions of people and, in doing so, lift up the country. They’re good for the micro and the macro.I think about the research of economists like Larry Katz at Harvard. There’s a whole body of literature around the EITC and what it does for single mothers and children. It improves mental health. It boosts employment and earnings. But Larry also found that expanding the EITC produces many of the same effects in single people, without children. There’s also a wide body of research around the Child Tax Credit. For years, economists have studied government payments to families with kids, and they’ve found that the money is linked to all sorts of positive things: better health, higher lifetime earnings, better high school graduation and college attendance rates. One recent study even found some evidence that when governments make cash payments to poorer mothers, there’s better brain development in their babies.When we took office last January, I think many of us looked at research like this and saw expanding the CTC and the EITC as one of the most promising antipoverty strategies we had in our arsenal – especially in the midst of the pandemic that swept millions of children and family under the poverty line.And so, that’s what the American Rescue Plan did. President Biden signed it into law about a year ago on Friday. It made tax credits both more generous and fully refundable, meaning that even the lowest income families, could get them.We had very high hopes for these policies, but as you’ve heard, the results lived up to even our most ambitious expectations. The last year witnessed the largest drop in child poverty in American history. After the first monthly CTC credit went out, food instability among low-income families with children dropped 43 percent. You could even see a nationwide sigh of relief in the data: 70 percent of caregivers reported that they were less stressed about making ends meet.And here is perhaps the most remarkable part: There’s still so much money on the table. Most families have only received half of their Child Tax Credits – or even less – and workers are only starting to see the expanded Earned Income Tax Credit now, as they file taxes and get their refunds. I think there’s a common notion – and it’s an understandable one – that once Congress passes a big relief package like the American Rescue Plan, the rest is almost automatic. The biggest hurdle is getting a bill to the president’s desk. The rest is easy.The truth, though, is that the machinery of government is complicated. It’s rusty in some places, and it was not designed to do exactly this. The American Rescue Plan charged the IRS with figuring out how to get tens of millions of families a monthly advance on this year’s Child Tax Credit. But the agency had never delivered these kinds of payments before. Certainly not on this scale and to families whose incomes were low enough that they weren’t required to file taxes.This is the problem we’ve spent many late nights solving over the past year, and your organizations have helped us. Together, we’ve built new tools for the IRS. We’ve redesigned the machinery of government, and as a result, we’ve sent out monthly payments to more than 30 million families, including 26 million lower-income children wo received the full Child Tax Credit for the first time.But our work, as I mentioned, is not done. There are still so many families who did not receive an advance payment, for example, because their child was only born last year and they’d not filed a tax return before. Or, because they’re a resident of Puerto Rico. In many cases, we’re talking about families who are still entitled to $3,000 to $3,600, depending on the age of their child. Right now, the best way – really the only way – to get people this money is for them to file their taxes. I know what a challenge that will be. Filing taxes can be hard, and we’re talking about some of the hardest-to-reach people in this country, people to whom the government has far too often been blind… but who your organizations excel at serving. Your knowledge, your experience is what’s required right now, and I can promise you that the US Treasury will provide you with every resource we have to help you do the job.The last thing I’ll say is: These policies have already done enormous good. They’ve produced a profound moral and economic achievement for America. Imagine the new scale of that achievement, though, when we finally get these benefits to the people who need them most.  "
328,,"January 25, 2022","As many of you know, when federal agencies train people to recognize the signs of trafficking, they often give them very clear pictures: a person with very few belongings, for instance, who may be living with their employer and is unable to speak to you alone. The idea is there are identifiable signs of human trafficking, and if we’re vigilant as we move about the everyday world, we can stop it. Well, the same holds true for the more arcane, and numbers-driven world of the financial system. We can recognize the patterns of human trafficking there, too.The fact that human traffickers launder their money through shell companies, or cryptocurrencies, or even traditional banks is not the worst aspect of their crime, but it is often the most effective way to catch them. One of the best strategies we have for ending modern day slavery is following the money.At Treasury, we have spent the last six years developing the tradecraft to do just that; the expertise to recognize the patterns of human trafficking in money flows. In the past, we’ve worked with various financial institutions – hundreds of banks – pooling our information and piecing together which accounts belonged to traffickers. This way, we could lock them out of the financial system and expose their crimes.We’ve continued that work this year in a few important ways. We partnered with DOJ, DHS, and the gaming industry, for instance, training employees at more than 400 casinos to recognize when a human trafficker is trying to launder their money.We’ve also begun the important process of exposing who owns certain shell companies in this country. In some states, almost anyone can establish a company without disclosing “the beneficial” or actual owner. This gives cover to all sorts of criminals – including human traffickers – to hide their illegal gains, and until recently it would’ve been very hard to stop them. But in 2020, Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act, which Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network – FinCEN – is now beginning to implement. The law allows us to build a national database of who owns what shell company – something that will let us better expose and deter human trafficking.There is one final point I want to make: I think we have an obligation not just to go after the perpetrators of modern-day slavery, but to help the victims of it, as well. This is something we’re thinking about at Treasury.We know one of the first things these traffickers do is strip their victims of their phones and IDs, which means that when they finally gain their freedom, trafficking survivors emerge into the world with little ability to navigate it. They can’t get a driver’s license. They can’t get a bank account.There are broad policies we’re promoting to breakdown these barriers. Digital ID is one. But we also have flexibility in our regulatory framework, which has allowed various banks to set up processes so that victims of human trafficking can get bank accounts and re-start their lives.I’m hopeful that when we participate in this meeting next year, we’ll have more to share with you on this front. Thank you, again, and I look forward to working with all of you on this crucial issue."
329,,"January 21, 2022","At this time of year, government officials, business executives, and thought leaders normally huddle in a small town in Switzerland to share perspectives on how to address the world’s biggest challenges.  I hope to join you all in person in Davos in the coming years.  In the meantime, the virtual nature of these meetings does not diminish the importance of the issues at hand. We have all been living through the COVID-19 pandemic for roughly two years now.  Policymakers, businesses large and small, and families alike have grappled with the uncertainty and unexpected twists of this ruthless pandemic and its associated economic disruption.  At the same time, longstanding challenges persist, and some were exacerbated by a pandemic that disproportionately impacted low-wage workers and minorities.  We still face growing divergence between rich and poor, within and between countries, along with the mounting risk of climate change.  Our navigation of these health and economic challenges will be consequential: for ending the pandemic, for mitigating climate change, and for ensuring the stability and prosperity of our respective economies and the global economic system. I will focus my remarks on the Biden Administration’s strategy to sustain our economic recovery and to address longstanding structural issues relating to income inequality, racial disparities, and climate change.   Let me start with where I see the U.S. economy right now.  By most traditional metrics, the pace of our current recovery has exceeded even the most optimistic expectations.  That’s due in large part to rapid vaccine deployment and the robust support to families, businesses, and state and local governments provided by the American Rescue Plan.  This is the kind of recovery that President Biden set out to deliver when he took office last year.Aggregate growth has been rapid and continued, with our real GDP expected to grow at 5.3 percent in 2021.  The most recent Blue Chip forecast put 2022 growth at 3.3 percent, noting that “COVID and supply-chain disruptions to the economy are not really expected to disrupt economic growth,” which in itself represents a stunning economic and policy achievement. The U.S. labor market is exceptionally strong.  Over 6 million jobs were added last year, and the unemployment rate is again below 4 percent.  Other metrics, such as the fraction of workers who quit their jobs, suggest that the labor market is very tight.  Historically, when quits have been high, workers have been moving to jobs they prefer: for higher wages and better working conditions.  Indeed, we now see upgrading of job quality and increases in nominal wages, especially at the lower end of the spectrum.Household and firm balance sheets are even healthier than before the pandemic.  To date, we have not seen large or persistent increases in long-term unemployment, indebtedness, evictions, or bankruptcies.  This contrasts with the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis.Of course, given the scale, novelty, and uncertain path of the pandemic, the recovery also comes with challenges.  Labor supply has yet to recover to pre-pandemic levels, as health, childcare, and other related challenges remain.  Inflation is a valid policy concern, and it has risen to levels not seen since the 1980s.  It far exceeds any increase that would normally result from a labor market with 3.9 percent unemployment.  I believe that the pronounced shift in spending away from services and toward goods contributed to outsized price increases.  Additionally, the associated supply chain bottlenecks are boosting costs and holding back production of automobiles and other key products.  Despite these challenges, it’s important to note that professional forecasters think that inflation will substantially abate next year.  Part of this view is likely driven by the expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to account for these pressures as it fulfills its dual mandate.  And as the President has remarked many times, the Administration continues to tirelessly seek strategies to alleviate these pressures through actions such as easing congestion in our ports and expanding the labor supply. Yet, even as policymakers continue to address rising prices, our economic recovery will face significant risks until we have moved more decisively past the pandemic. Now let me turn to economic policy.  I will use the term “modern supply side economics” to describe the Biden Administration’s economic growth strategy, and I’ll contrast it with Keynesian and traditional supply-side approaches.     The American Rescue Plan, enacted into law in March 2021, ensured that aggregate demand would return the economy to full employment—which was appropriate at that time in response to the crisis.  In this respect, the Biden strategy was similar to the “Keynesian approach”  championed, for example, by the Obama Administration in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis and embodied in earlier stimulus packages enacted to combat previous downturns. What we are really comparing our new approach against is traditional “supply side economics,” which also seeks to expand the economy’s potential output, but through aggressive deregulation paired with tax cuts designed to promote private capital investment.  It is, unquestionably, important to properly implement regulation and maintain a pro-growth tax code, but they are not sufficient and can often be overdone.  Modern supply side economics, in contrast, prioritizes labor supply, human capital, public infrastructure, R&D, and investments in a sustainable environment.  These focus areas are all aimed at increasing economic growth and addressing longer-term structural problems, particularly inequality.  The recently enacted Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill and the Build Back Better legislation that remains under consideration in Congress incorporate this modern supply side approach. Our new approach is far more promising than the old supply side economics, which I see as having been a failed strategy for increasing growth.  Significant tax cuts on capital have not achieved their promised gains.  And deregulation has a similarly poor track record in general and with respect to environmental policies—especially so with respect to curbing CO2 emissions.  Moreover, this approach has deepened disparities in income and wealth by shifting the burden of taxation away from capital and towards labor.  As Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo found, capital-based automation has also played a role—and perhaps the major role—in widening educational wage gaps between 1980 and 2016.A country’s long-term growth potential depends on the size of its labor force, the productivity of its workers, the renewability of its resources, and the stability of its political systems.  Modern supply side economics seeks to spur economic growth by both boosting labor supply and raising productivity, while reducing inequality and environmental damage.  Essentially, we aren’t just focused on achieving a high topline growth number that is unsustainable—we are instead aiming for growth that is inclusive and green.The economic moment is well-suited to accommodate such a modern supply side expansion. Potential GDP in the United States is constrained by a declining labor force.  And with few exceptions, productivity growth has been sluggish since the late 1970s.  We have underinvested in public infrastructure, and in education and training for children and all those who have not sought  a four-year college degree.  This underinvestment has widened the gap in earnings between highly skilled workers and those who lack a college degree—a gap that has relentlessly increased since the late 1970s. Importantly, the Biden Administration’s economic strategy embraces, rather than rejects, collaboration with the private sector through a combination of improved market-based incentives and direct spending based on empirically proven strategies.  For example, a package of incentives and rebates for clean energy, electric vehicles, and decarbonization will incentivize companies to make these critical investments. Labor supply has been a concern in the United States even before the pandemic, in part due to an aging population and in part due to a labor force participation rate that has trended downward over the past 20 years.  Now COVID and declining immigration have further reduced the workforce.  The lagging labor force participation rate is driven in large part by a combination of factors that disincentivize work, such as inadequate paid leave and high childcare costs. While the final details of a package continue to be discussed by the Administration and Congress, the core of Build Back Better counters these trends by making it easier for working-age parents to participate in the labor market.  It proposes two additional years of universal early childhood education along with expanded elder care.  It seeks to cap childcare expenditures for most families at 7 percent of their income.  And an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit is intended to provide greater economic security to households while incentivizing lower-income workers to seek employment.  These programs should help to reverse the ongoing decline in the U.S. labor force participation rate relative to other developed countries and to boost potential GDP growth.A second focus of the Biden agenda is to enhance productivity. Over the last decade, U.S. labor productivity growth averaged a mere 1.1 percent—roughly half that during the previous fifty years.  This has contributed to slow growth in wages and compensation, with especially slow historical gains for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution.  There is a concern, however, that technological advancement that boosts productivity growth may exacerbate, rather than mitigate, inequality.  This possibility is illustrated by the pandemic-induced surge in telework.  A recent study forecasts that the gains from expanded telework will ultimately raise U.S. productivity by 2.7 percent.[1]  Yet, those gains are not likely to be equally shared.  Upper-income white-collar workers are likely to enjoy the largest benefit.  Increased online learning is another pandemic induced technological shift that is likely to widen the educational achievement and productivity gap between upper-income children relative to those who are lower-income and minority.  The Biden Administration aims to boost labor productivity in ways that will help to address the disparities in wage growth.  The focus is on enhancing the skills of workers—and particularly those with low incomes—to be able to take advantage of new technologies.  To do this, we are proposing wide-ranging investments in human capital—from early childhood education to community college, apprenticeships, and worker training. Additionally, long-overdue investments in infrastructure—such as broadband, as well as ports, roads, and rail—should benefit American families, workers, and businesses alike.  At the same time, we are investing in new energy infrastructure and support for R&D to incentivize innovation in renewable energy technologies.  These investments should promote sustainable growth by addressing climate change and mitigate extreme weather events, which also have disproportionate impact on the poor. A third aspect of the Administration’s supply side agenda relates to taxation.The current system of multinational taxation constricts supply by rewarding companies that shift real economic activity for tax-driven reasons, thereby discouraging efficient deployment of capital and undercutting fiscal resources that can fund supply expansions.Over the past several decades the burden of taxation—in the United States and globally—has shifted away from corporations and onto the middle class.  A significant reason for this shift is  tax competition among nations.  This competition has created a race to the bottom in corporate tax rates on footloose capital.  In this competition, no country is a winner, and working and middle-class people around the world lose.  Large multinational corporations have been incentivized to stash profits in their low-taxed subsidiaries around the world in tax-driven and inefficient transactions.  This race-to-the-bottom thus depletes governments of the resources they need for the complex challenges they face.  From the U.S. perspective, perverse corporate tax incentives have caused some companies to shift real economic activity beyond our borders, further contracting supply and reducing our nation’s productive capacity.     This past summer, in a remarkable testament to the power of U.S. leadership and multilateralism, 137 countries—representing nearly 95 percent of the world’s GDP—have agreed to rewrite the international tax rules to impose a global minimum tax on corporate foreign earnings.This historic global tax deal will end this race to the bottom by ensuring that profitable corporations pay their fair share, providing governments with resources to invest in their people and economies.  At the same time, it will level the playing field so that all multinational companies will face a minimum tax on their foreign earnings, rather than just U.S. companies. This new system will improve productivity by incentivizing businesses to allocate capital to its most productive use, rather than to the use that produces that best tax result.  A more efficient allocation of capital via a more level playing field, achieved in a manner that improves fairness for workers, represents a win-win that aligns with the modern supply side approach.Finally, the agreement will also stabilize the rapidly eroding international tax system by updating its rules to reflect a 21st century economy.  The new rules recognize that a business can be meaningfully involved in the economic life of a country without necessarily being physically present there.  They will replace a chaotic array of unilateral tax measures that countries enacted in response to growing dissatisfaction with the status quo, but that burdened an increasing scope of U.S. businesses with multiple layers of taxation, discriminated against them, and created trade tensions that threatened economic growth and investment.  These new rules can provide much needed tax certainty and clarity to our businesses that will benefit them and their workers.Let me further note that the Biden Administration’s leadership in negotiating this multilateral tax agreement is emblematic of our larger commitment to multilateral collaboration.  Global cooperation is vital to address the common challenges that all of us now face.  The global nature of the pandemic epitomizes the intertwined fates of all of us on this planet.  COVID demands a truly global response, as alleviating the virus within our borders requires fighting it abroad.  Of course, climate change represents an existential threat that will require close global coordination and robust efforts by individual countries to reach their net zero commitments.   To conclude, many of us participating in this week’s discussions have been centrally involved in economic policy for decades—navigating the expansions, the shocks, and the recessions.  It is safe to say that this economic recovery is unlike any other we have seen in part because economic and health outcomes are so closely intertwined.My economists at Treasury today are monitoring vaccination and health statistics in parallel to the latest economic indicators.  Fortunately, we have brilliant medical professionals, scientists, and health policy experts working tirelessly to end the pandemic in our country and beyond.Moreover, we, as policymakers and business leaders, now recognize that we must respond to the demands of our citizens to use this recovery to make our economies and the world a more sustainable, fairer place. I am optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.  We have a clear path forward with the recently passed infrastructure package and the proposed Build Back Better plan.  Together these policies will promote a modern supply side expansion that boosts long-term sustainable growth, protects the environment, and distributes expanding national income more equally.  I am confident that we can beat this pandemic and move decisively down the path toward a more prosperous future."
330,,"January 19, 2022","There have been few harder – or more crucial – jobs during this pandemic than being a mayor. Local governments have been the first line of defense against this pandemic, and as much as anything else, it has been the work of the city that has kept our recovery on track. That’s what I want to talk about today.  Almost exactly a year ago – 364 days this morning, to be precise – I was putting on a very large coat and getting ready to drive to the National Mall to watch President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris take the oath of office. Roughly thirty-nine hundred Americans would die of COVID that day – and the next. 
More Americans were applying for unemployment insurance than during the worst week of the 
Great Recession, and millions of people said they didn’t have enough food to eat. Some economists were making dire predictions – that the pandemic would plunge our economy further into recession, with many more jobs lost. Of course, such predictions never materialized. In fact, if somehow you transported a group of economists – including me – from that moment to today… and just showed us the current topline data… we would be quite thrilled. Unemployment is now at 3.9 percent – the sharpest one-year drop in the rate ever. GDP now exceeds pre-pandemic levels, and 2021 witnessed one of the biggest reductions in child poverty and child hunger in American history. Yes, Omicron has presented a challenge and will likely impact some of the data in the coming months, but I am confident it will not derail what has been one of the strongest periods of economic growth in a century. None of this was guaranteed. I think it’s important we recognize that. There’s a very real counterfactual where Omicron did derail our recovery; a scenario where the new variant hurdled our economy backwards towards its state on Inauguration Day 2021. Well, there are innumerable reasons. One, obviously, is that most of the country is now vaccinated. But it’s also quite clear that you – that mayors – had something to do with it. The reason January 2022 is not January 2021 is, in large part, due to what’s happening in local governments. I think the best place to begin the story is 10 months ago, in March. That was the pivotal moment, a time where the future could’ve forked in different directions. In fact, it was the last time I spoke to many of you at a gathering of city leaders. The American Rescue Plan – or the ARP – had passed the Senate and awaited a final vote in the House.  Many of you had teleconferenced into various congressional offices to push the bill to that point and to the make the case for one of its largest programs: The State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund, $350 billion dollars to help communities make it to the other side of the pandemic.  At the time, I think we all believed that state and local funding was important; that it was essential. In retrospect, though, that program in particular – and the ARP in general – proved absolutely essential. You can draw a straight line between the ARP’s passage and our economic performance during Delta and Omicron. As this group knows better than anyone, the first year of the pandemic decimated government budgets, forcing states and communities to layoff or furlough a collective 1.3 million workers. 
These were the employees we rightly called “essential” – teachers, first responders, public health officials. How would your cities be different if those essential workers stayed off the job? It’s a question that probably has a very unpleasant answer. I think about the challenge schools are facing now, and then I imagine how they’d navigate that same challenge… but with hundreds of thousands fewer teachers and other school staff. I expect that would’ve been the case without the ARP. Of course, you are the experts, but it seems hard to overstate how quickly and completely the ARP changed the everyday institutions that keep our society working.  Hawaii, for instance, had planned to furlough 10,000 employees, but on the day President Biden signed the Rescue Plan they cancelled the layoffs. Denver was able to rehire for 265 city staff positions left vacant because of pandemic-related cuts, while Wichita, Kansas is hiring for 161 jobs, everything from animal control officers… to security screeners… to street and park maintenance workers.  Many places have used the ARP funding not only to hire for public sector jobs, but to rebuild elements of the private sector that are essential to weathering pandemic. Columbus, Ohio, for example, is providing $1,000-dollar signing bonuses for new teachers at childcare centers. They’re also granting scholarships to low-income families so their kids can attend. This, I think, is some of what the $350 billion did: When Omicron started spreading around our cities, it did not find them broke and broken; it found them much readier to respond. In some ways, the ARP acted like a vaccine for the American economy, protecting our recovery from the possibility of new variants. The protection wasn’t complete, but it was very strong – and it prevented communities from suffering the most severe economic effects of Omicron and Delta. Of course, the relief package did not predict when exactly those variants would emerge, but it did anticipate that our recovery would run up against some unforeseen barriers. The pandemic produced a highly unusual economic crisis – one tied not to the movements of markets but to the spread and evolution of microbes. The crisis could ebb and flow. It would hit different places in different ways at different times. The state and local fund was designed with that in mind, too. Rather than one burst of money that could only be spent in certain ways, it called for sustained funding, and our Treasury team has worked hard so you can use the money as flexibly as possible. Indeed, in response to Omicron, cities and states across the country have used ARP money to put on a clinic in quick and creative government. Many have provided extra support to vaccine campaigns. Others have built up their public health infrastructure. In recent weeks, Minnesota has authorized over $80 million in ARP funds for everything from the distribution of rapid COVID tests to emergency surge staffing in hospitals. Then are cities like St. Louis, which saw that two trends were colliding: the spread of new variants and the expiration of the nation’s eviction moratorium. There was a risk that people were going to lose the roofs over their heads, something that would not only complicate our efforts to stop the spread but also complicate people’s lives for years to come.   St. Louis had been busy dispersing dollars from the ARP’s emergency rental assistance program, but also chose to use $58 million of its state and local dollars to keep people in their homes and shelter those experiencing homelessness.  Today, eviction filings are 60 percent below their pre-pandemic levels in large part because of work like that. We’ve avoided a national eviction crisis because mayors like you have helped build the infrastructure to deliver over three million rental assistance payments into the pockets of renters.  In this country, we don’t often recognize the crises that do not happen; we don’t celebrate the bridge that doesn’t collapse. But maybe in this case, we should. Last year, the first time I spoke to a group of mayors, I said that fiscal policy often finds humanity in the city budget. But in 2021, it may have been that our economy found its salvation in the city budget. Of course, the job of fully implementing the ARP is not done yet, and our team is ready to continue working with you on projects from building affordable housing… to rehiring of educators… to the laying of broadband. But there’s a good argument that without your work thus far – and without the Biden Administration’s relief funding – we would be reliving something approximating the early days of the pandemic. And not just now, but for some time to come.  That was the lesson of 2008. During the Great Recession, when cities and states were facing similar revenue shortfalls, the federal government didn’t provide enough aid to close the gap. It was a profound error. Cities had to slash spending, and that undermined the broader recovery. One study concludes that for every $1 local governments cut in spending during a recession, there is a corresponding drop in GDP of more than $1 – and possibly as much as $3. After 2008, state government employment didn’t recover from the Great Recession until 2019.More than just protecting and accelerating our recovery, I think that the passage of the American Rescue Plan finally allowed us to do what most of us came to government for – not simply to fight fires and resolve crises, but to build a better country. It gave us a window to start building a better post-COVID world. By helping us alleviate the immediate crisis, the American Rescue Plan created the environment for new, transformational legislation: the infrastructure bill, the biggest investment we’ve made since Eisenhower built the Interstate. And congressional negotiations are ongoing regarding the Build Back Better legislation. While we don’t know the final form this will take, it will revolutionize how we care for children in this country, invest in climate change, and overhaul the international tax system to ensure 
corporations pay their fair share. Paired together, these pieces of legislation amount to a once-in-a-generation transformation of our economy. They will lead to higher rates of productivity, an expanded labor force, and greater GDP growth. None of it would’ve been possible without the American Rescue Plan and your partnership with Treasury to implement it. I am forever grateful for your partnership during the last ten months, and I look forward to continuing to work with you over the years ahead."
331,,"January 17, 2022","Hello, everyone, and thank you, Reverend Sharpton, for inviting me today. It’s a real pleasure to join NAN in celebrating the life and legacy of “the moral leader of our nation,” which is what A. Phillip Randolph called Dr. King on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, moments before inviting him to deliver the “I Have a Dream” speech. Like many people, I use this holiday to reacquaint myself with that remarkable speech and was interested see to that Dr. King uses a financial metaphor in a key passage. “When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence,” he said, “they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.”  “It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned,” he continued, “[They’ve been given] a bad check, a check which has come back marked insufficient funds. But we refuse to believe the bank of justice is bankrupt!” It is compelling rhetoric, but I also think Dr. King knew it was a more than a metaphor. He knew that economic injustice was bound up in the larger injustice he fought against. From Reconstruction, to Jim Crow, to the present day, our economy has never worked fairly for Black Americans – or, really, for any American of color. Well, since taking office last January, our administration has tried to change that; to ensure that neither the figurative bank of justice – nor any literal economic institution – fails to work for people of color. It has been a year of action, especially at the Treasury Department. We’ve completed Treasury’s first equity review, looking across the Department and asking: Where are our operations not as inclusive as they should be? And then there’s Treasury’s pandemic response. We knew that the communities hurt most by COVID were often communities of color, and so as we began implementing relief bills like the American Rescue Plan, we did so with equity in mind.  We announced there that Treasury was injecting $9 billion dollars into Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions. These CDFIs and MDIs serve people and places that the financial sector historically hasn’t served well. We also included CEOs from some of the country’s largest financial institutions in the meeting. Beyond just injecting capital in CDFIs and MDIs, we wanted to find ways for these larger institutions to partner with them so they could scale up even further. Of course, no one program and no one administration can make good on the hopes and aspirations that Dr. King had for our country. There is still much more work Treasury needs to do to narrow the racial wealth divide.  We also know that progress requires a constellation of actors across generations, in and out of government – and that is why NAN’s work remains so essential. Thank you, all, for your partnership and your leadership. I look forward to continuing the effort for racial and economic equality in 2022. "
332,,"January 14, 2022","WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement today on President Joe Biden’s nominations to the Federal Reserve.“President Biden has nominated a full slate of nominees to the Federal Reserve that are committed to the board’s dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment and represent a diversity of backgrounds that will bring important new perspectives.We continue to face new challenges as we confront the pandemic and its variants, but we have made remarkable strides to put our economy on strong footing. I am confident these nominees will build on that progress. I also know that these individuals will respect the tradition of an independent Fed, as they work to fight inflation, support a strong labor market and ensure our economic growth benefits all workers.I strongly believe that a fully staffed Federal Reserve is critical to our economic success, and I urge the Senate to act swiftly to confirm these nominees.”"
333,,"December 17, 2021","Today, the Council is releasing its 2021 annual report.  The report has one eye on the past and one on the future.  It analyzes recent episodes of financial turmoil to understand weak points in our financial system and identifies potential threats.  It reviews actions taken by the Council to strengthen our financial system and recommends additional steps that could be taken by the public and private sectors. The report marks nearly two years since the first appearance of COVID-19 and the resulting financial turmoil in March 2020.  As the economy began to shut down that month, many investors sought safety in the form of cash and short-term government securities.  Corporate and municipal bond markets became illiquid. Of course, increased capital and liquidity helped banks weather the crisis, and in that way, the episode showed that our financial system is far more shock-resistant than it was in 2008.  As this report shows, the lessons of 2008 and 2020 strongly inform the Council’s work. I am pleased to have this opportunity to summarize the work of the Council.  In particular, I would like to take a moment to review three key priorities for the Council that I outlined nine months ago in my first meeting as Chair. The first priority was nonbank financial intermediation, including money market funds, open-end mutual funds, and hedge funds.  In March 2020, we saw that open-end mutual funds and prime money market funds could amplify liquidation pressures because of liquidity risk in their business models and the incentives they give to investors.  The same held true for hedge funds because of their use of leverage. Our report reviews the Council’s progress on work related to these sectors.  In June, the Council issued a statement regarding the structural vulnerabilities of MMFs.  It called for reforms that would improve the resilience and functioning of short-term funding markets. The Council expressed support for the SEC’s engagement on this critical issue, and I was pleased to note the SEC’s proposed rule earlier this week.  The Council will continue to monitor this effort.  In addition, the Council’s working groups on open-end funds and on hedge funds are assessing the risks posed by these types of firms, and will evaluate whether actions are necessary to address their vulnerabilities. A second priority was the resilience of the U.S. Treasury market.  The Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid market in the world.  Because of its critical importance to the financial system, we must understand the disruptions that have occurred in that market.  The Council’s annual report reviews the progress of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance, which has worked closely with the Council to study what happened in March 2020 and what it had in common with other recent episodes.  The interagency working group is analyzing ways to improve the Treasury market’s resilience.  They’re looking at possible policies to improve data quality and availability, bolster the resilience of market intermediation, evaluate expanded central clearing, and enhance trading venue transparency and oversight. The annual report also discusses the Council’s new body of work around climate-related financial risks, the third priority I spoke of in March.  I am very pleased at the Council’s progress in the short period since then. As I’ve previously said, even as the Council and regulators make progress in ensuring that the past does not repeat itself, we must keep in mind the maxim that we cannot simply “fight the last war.”  The Council is required to evaluate and respond to new and emerging threats. With this purpose in mind, the Council issued a Report on Climate-Related Financial Risk in October that made recommendations to promote the resilience of the financial system.  These steps include expanding capacity, improving data and measurement, enhancing disclosure of climate-related risks, assessing the scale of potential vulnerabilities, and adjusting regulatory and supervisory tools.  To help coordinate our efforts on these issues, the report called for the Council to establish a new staff committee, the Climate-related Financial Risk Committee.  And later in today’s meeting, the Council will vote to do so. Of course, climate is not the only emerging risk.  As the annual report details, risks to U.S. financial stability are elevated compared to before the pandemic even as the financial vulnerabilities of banks and central counterparties are low.  For instance, the report discusses potential shocks related to the elevated level of uncertainty characterizing the global growth outlook.  The report also discusses vulnerabilities related to elevated asset prices, for example. In addition, the report highlights the critical importance of regulatory attention and coordination regarding stablecoins and other crypto assets, as the market for these assets continues to rapidly grow and evolve.  Cybersecurity also remains a high priority, as does the LIBOR transition.  I look forward to engaging with the Council in 2022 on these issues and others discussed in the report. "
334,,"December 14, 2021","This is the Freedman’s Bank Forum, and I know most of us are familiar with the history. Founded by Lincoln in 1865 to help newly freed slaves build wealth, the bank’s books were in shambles by 1874 – largely because of poor oversight by a Congress that had waning interest in Reconstruction.Frederick Douglass, who had agreed to be the bank’s president, tried to save it by depositing $10,000 of his own money. The show of confidence didn’t work. The bank failed, and more than 61,000 African Americans lost their savings. Douglass’ biographer, David Blight, called the affair “one of the great aspirations, but also one of the great tragedies, of Reconstruction.”We are here today because, in many ways, we’re still living with both that aspiration and that tragedy. The Vice President just described this very well: From Reconstruction, to Jim Crow, to the present day, our economy has never worked fairly for Black Americans – or, really, for any American of color.Well, since stepping foot in this building last January, we have tried to change that – to finally make good on the aspiration of the Freedman’s Bank by transforming how Treasury works. We’ve completed Treasury’s first equity review, looking across the Department and asking: Where are our operations not as inclusive as they could be?We’ve brought on the most diverse leadership team in Treasury’s history – half of our senior appointees are people of color – and we’ve hired the Department’s first ever counselor on racial equity. (If you haven’t met Janis Bowdler yet, you will in a moment.)Our most recent measure, though, is the news that the Vice President just mentioned: Through our Emergency Capital Investment Program (or ECIP), Treasury will be injecting nearly $9 billion dollars into Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions. These CDFIs and MDIs serve communities that the financial sector historically hasn’t served well – and most of the time, those are communities of color. If you’re a Black or Hispanic or Asian or Native entrepreneur, we know it’s harder to get your hands on funding to open to shop, or to keep the lights on, or meet customer demand.This has been particularly true during the pandemic. In their recent Small Business Credit Survey, the Fed found that while roughly 40 percent of white-owned firms reported receiving all the non-emergency funding they sought last year, the number for Hispanic-owned firms was half that – 21 percent. And for black-owned firms, it was just 13 percent.Contained in that 13 percent is a woman named Brandi Shelton, who I met a few months ago when I visited her tea shop in Atlanta. Just Add Honey was the name. Brandi owned the shop. She used to own three “Just Add Honeys,” in fact, but during the pandemic, when money was tight, she needed credit to keep her other locations afloat, and no one would give it to her.Fiscal policy can be a complex thing, and sometimes it’s very difficult to state with clarity and certainty how a particular program or statute will change someone’s life. But that’s not the case here – here, it’s very easy to connect the policy with the personal. You can draw a straight line from the money we’re injecting into high-performing CDFIs and other institutions to a tea shop in Atlanta. Because what this will do is prevent small business owners of color from closing two of their locations. And better yet, it will help people open two more. It will ensure that our markets no longer just a small fraction of businesses with the funding they need.Of course, one program is not enough to fully make up for the tragedy – or make good on the aspirations – of the Freedman’s Bank or of the Greenwood District, which the Vice President spoke about. But it is a start. And you should know this is just one example of how we’re implementing pandemic relief – with equity at the heart of things.The last thing I want to say is: None of this is happening by default, and I’m so glad that Leader Schumer, Chairwoman Waters, Chairman Brown, and Senator Warner are here today – because they pushed this program through Congress.Most of all, I want to thank the Vice President. Vice President Harris helped design the ECIP legislation when she was still Senator Harris. She has shepherded this program from a policy paper idea out into the world."
335,,"December 9, 2021","This gathering is a remarkable cross-section of the world’s democracies and, as we have heard so far, we share a common adversary: corruption. Whether it’s public officials on the take or laws that apply to everyone except the well-connected, corruption makes a mockery of our free and fair institutions. That is one thing all acts of corruption have in common, but today, I would like to focus my remarks on another shared link – and that is the global financial system. Corruption, after all, is just a form of financial alchemy. It’s the transformation of power into illicit money or illicit money into power, and in order to catalyze that transformation, bad actors usually need an intermediary, a place to store or launder their ill-gotten gains: a shell company, a real estate transaction, an art purchase. For this reason, combatting corruption is not just the work of the justice ministries – of prosecutors and law enforcement agents. It is also the work of finance ministries – of financial regulators and economic development experts. And we believe that our finance ministry, in particular – The United States Treasury – must play a leading role. The U.S. financial system is the backbone of the world economy. Enormous amounts of illicit funds can pass through – or land – in our markets. But just because bad actors want to launder money through the United States does not mean we need to make it easy for them. There are far too many financial shadows in America that give corruption cover. We need to throw a spotlight on them, and that is what we are doing through many of the measures that are part of the government’s holistic strategy to combat corruption, which we released this week. In the popular imagination, the money laundering capitals of the world are small countries with histories of loose and secretive financial laws. But there’s a good argument that, right now, the best place to hide and launder ill-gotten gains is actually the United States. And that’s because of the way we allow people to establish shell companies. Since Andrew Jackson, individual states have been free to set their own rules for incorporating companies, and since the early 20th century, some states have allowed anybody to establish a shell company without disclosing who really owns it, what we term “the beneficial owner.” This is about to change. Thanks to Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network – FinCEN – we’re now in the process of implementing the Corporate Transparency Act. A big bipartisan majority passed the law last year, and it allows us to build a national database of who owns what shell company. On Tuesday, FinCEN, issued a proposed rule to collect the necessary information that will help us build this database. It will require many U.S. and foreign companies to report their true beneficial owners to FinCEN and to update that information when those beneficial owners change. We’re also ensuring a similar principle applies to real estate because many corrupt actors can hide their money in Miami or Central Park skyscrapers the same way they do in shell companies. An LLC or trust can be listed as the owner. A lawyer can sign the paperwork. Indeed, sometimes the only thing these luxury properties are home to are ill-gotten gains – they’re money laundromats on the 81st floor. And so, we’re also soliciting public feedback on a future rulemaking, one that will make sure that when someone buys one of these properties with all cash, they can’t hide their identity. Of course, these are just a few of our efforts. Once we shine a light on places where corrupt actors operate, we need to go after them, like when we see people pocketing money that is meant go towards crucial public efforts like fighting the pandemic. Today, Treasury sanctioned several corrupt actors, including two who did exactly this. We’ve also established a kleptocracy fund to reward people who can provide intelligence about where corrupt foreign leaders are hiding their money in the United States. This work – the work shutting kleptocrats out of American markets and pursuing them abroad – is work we’re carrying out with partners at State, Justice, and USAID. In fact, today, the State Department announced a new coordinator on Global Anticorruption Issues and committed a substantial amount of funding to support members of the media and other activists who expose bad actors. USAID is launching a series of programs with similar goals. But let me close by saying this: It’s very important that we recognize that it’s not only foreign actors who abuse our financial system. There is corruption here at home. Especially when it comes to how people pay taxes – or rather, how they don’t. Last year, more than $600 billion was withheld from public coffers because of our broken tax system, which effectively lets the country’s top earners and largest corporations get away with evasion. Obviously, there’s a difference between a tax evader and autocrat who drains the public treasury, but the financial implications are similar: The country is deprived of funding for things that benefit everyone – education, childcare, roads and bridges. The dollar that stays in a tax cheat’s account is also the dollar denied to the child who needs subsidized kindergarten. After all, the United States cannot be a credible voice for free and fair government abroad if at the same time, we allow the wealthy to break our laws with impunity. The idea of democracy is bound up in the idea of America. If we want free institutions to thrive the world over, then first, we must model what they look like at home. "

This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed.

338,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

340,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
341,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

342,,"November 22, 2021","WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released the following statement today on President Joe Biden’s nominations to the Federal Reserve. “Over the last two years, the American economy has endured one of the most challenging episodes in our nation’s history. The global and domestic economies were brought to a standstill and millions of American families were at risk of permanent scarring. Today, our economy has rebounded with strong job creation, low unemployment, and economic growth that has outpaced our global competitors. The steady leadership of Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve helped ensure that America’s economy was able to recover from a once-in-a-generation health and economic crisis. An independent and experienced Federal Reserve was critically important to navigating this turbulent time and will continue to be crucial as we recover and confront new threats to our economy. Over the past few years, Chair Powell has provided strong leadership at the Federal Reserve to effectively meet and address unexpected economic and financial challenges, and I am pleased our economy will continue to benefit from his stewardship. I am also grateful that the President has nominated Lael Brainard to serve as Vice Chair. Dr. Brainard is a respected economist with years of experience and has been instrumental in the nation’s recovery. As Treasury Secretary, I will continue to support a strong and independent Federal Reserve, empowered to pursue its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment to benefit American workers and families.”

343,,"November 19, 2021","WASHINGTON - Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen issued the following statement on the U.S. House of Representatives passage of the Build Back Better Act.""I’m very grateful to Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives for passing the Build Back Better Act. Today’s vote moves us closer to a stronger, more resilient economy with greater productivity and labor force participation and a lower tax burden on middle class families.This fiscally responsible package takes aim at the challenges many middle class families face:  It makes childcare affordable, freeing parents from having to choose between raising kids and working a job. It prevents children from entering the first grade at a disadvantage by providing universal pre-K. It gives seniors the affordable care and housing they need.  As important, the Build Back Better Act also makes an historically large investment in combatting climate change. This bill is more than fully paid for by asking large corporations and the country’s top earners to pay their fair share and by finally ensuring high-income tax evaders pay what they owe."
344,,"November 18, 2021","“The Build Back Better Act will improve the lives of workers, grow our economy, cut taxes for the middle class, and lower costs for families on a wide range of household expenses, such as child care and prescription drugs.The combination of CBO’s scores over the last week, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates, and Treasury analysis, make it clear that Build Back Better is fully paid for, and in fact will reduce our nation’s debt over time by generating more than $2 trillion through reforms that ask the wealthiest Americans and large corporations to pay their fair share. A particularly salient aspect of the revenue raised by the legislation is a historic investment in the IRS to crack down on high-earners who avoid paying the taxes that they owe, which Treasury estimates would generate at least $400 billion in additional revenue.With this bill, members of Congress have a unique opportunity to put our economy on a path to increased growth, productivity, labor force participation, and equity, while ensuring we do not burden future generations with unsustainable debt. I urge them to pass it.”"
345,,"November 16, 2021","You know, only a few days after I started this job, one of my first meetings was with a group of small business owners. And at these gatherings, everyone’s story strikes a chord, but some strike a chord louder and more poignantly than others. And I remember there was woman named Shayai Lucero. She lived on tribal land in New Mexico where she ran a flower shop: Earth and Sky Floral. The celebrations of life were how she made her living, and all of them – weddings, proms, Mother’s Day gatherings – had been cancelled because of the pandemic.In retrospect, one of the reasons her story stuck with our team was that, as we surveyed our Department in those early days, we realized we didn’t have the adequate personnel or the resources to help her. Treasury’s engagement with tribes has historically been limited to the Internal Revenue Service. The Department has never had a full understanding of how our policies affect Tribal economies.I don’t know if this is very surprising to anyone. Stories of native marginalization are older than the country, and you do not need a PhD in economics to know that our economy has never worked well for Native Americans or people living in Indian country. But this, I think, is why we’re here; not just at this summit, but here, in Washington, to govern. Our entire department – our entire administration – is dedicated to the task of changing things; to ensuring that Native communities are counted; that you’re heard; and that you are represented in the halls of places like Treasury, and in the ways we design and implement policy.  Indeed, we’ve spent the past year building up our capacity to do this, recognizing that it is more important now – in the year 2021 – than ever before.It has been a hard year-and-a-half for the entire nation, but it has been a particularly hard time for Native Americans. When our administration entered office, Tribal communities had some of the highest COVID mortality rates in the country, and as the health emergency spilled over into the economy, the data showed that few suffered more than Native American workers and business. In fact, just last week, Brookings released new research showing that Native Americans, compared to any other demographic group, were more likely to have their work hours cut or lose their health insurance during the pandemic.When President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan last March, Treasury was tasked with administering an enormous amount of relief dollars to ease this pain. That included more than $21 billion in direct relief to Tribal governments and assistance to Tribal families via stimulus payments and the Child Tax Credit. To date, more than 99.9% of our largest fund, the $20 billion Tribal set aside, is out the door. As these things go, that is quite fast.There are a few reasons for the expediency, but one is that we built a dedicated tribal team inside our Office of Recovery Programs, staffed with experts who had Tribal government and enterprise experience. They were instrumental in doing what Treasury traditionally hadn’t done enough of – working tribal governments to help design these policies. There were more than 10 consultation meetings and 50 information sessions over the past year, and those led us to make better decisions on policy guidance. Now this funding is serving a range of crucial purposes – supporting vaccination efforts, helping tribal businesses recover, providing affordable housing.We’re going to keep doing everything we can to make sure your communities make it to the other side of this crisis, but we also recognize that that’s not enough. After all, long before a single person was infected with COVID-19, Indian Country bore a disproportionate amount of the hardship in America. We know that for you and your communities, a return to a pre-pandemic economy is neither desirable nor acceptable. We have to build back better, as the President says.Both the new infrastructure legislation and the Build Back Better bill will do enormous good on this score. One example is the childcare situation, which is a national crisis but is especially horrific for Native Americans. Half of Native American children don’t attend preschool, and 1-in-10 Native Americans report having to quit or turn down a job to take care of their kids. Build Back Better would expand access to daycare centers and guarantee every child two years of pre-K. That’s going to improve the workforce in your communities now, as parents return to work, but also years from now as the children who benefit from this care grow up. We know attending high-quality pre-K confers all sorts of benefits later in life, including higher-paying jobs.You know, I’ve spent almost my entire life thinking about economics and how it can help people during hard times. My father was a doctor in Brooklyn. He was also a child of the Depression. He had a very visceral reaction to economic hardship. When one of his patients lost a job or couldn’t pay, it hurt him – and he’d tell us about it. Those remain some of the clearest moments in my childhood.Economics is sometimes considered a dry subject, but I have always tried to approach my science the same way my dad approached his: as a means to help people. I have always tried to see the humanity beneath the numbers. I’m not sure you can be a good economic policymaker if you don’t.That’s why I plan to visit Indian Country over the next year – to speak to more parents, more workers, more flower-shop owners. But it’s also why I’m so grateful to this community for its partnership, both today, at this summit, and over the past year. You have helped our team understand the wants, the needs, and the economic pain of Native Americans. In doing so, you’ve not only made us better policymakers. You’ve made us, I think, a better country."
346,,"November 9, 2021","WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen delivered remarks at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV) Center for Business and Economic Research Outlook Conference. In her speech, Secretary Yellen highlighted the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act - the once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure that will grow our economy sustainability and equitably.“On Friday night, Congress rendered a final and favorable vote on President Biden’s infrastructure bill, which will soon be signed into law. This kind of infrastructure bill – something on the scale of the project to build the Interstate Highway System – has been the ambition of lawmakers for a long, long time. Now it’s finally happened. […] Built Back Better is the biggest investment in American infrastructure since Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System.There’s a somewhat famous historical anecdote about a 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Dwight Eisenhower and how he participated in one of the first cross-country roadtrips. This was 1919. An army convoy left Washington, DC on July 7. It reached San Francisco 62 days later, in mid-September, during which time various vehicles broke down along dirt roads, collapsed wooden bridges, and had to be towed by horses. It impressed upon the young Eisenhower that a modern economy could never be built with the current infrastructure and made him see, as he later wrote in his autobiography, “the wisdom of broader ribbons [of road] across the land.Well, we have lived our own version of Eisenhower’s cross-country trip during the past 20 months. The pandemic has shown us that our current infrastructure is not fit for a modern economy.One of the more memorable articles I read during the pandemic was about students from Orrum, North Carolina, who would regularly drive to a McDonald’s parking lot. They’d go there to do their classwork because they were some of the millions of Americans who can’t access high-speed broadband at home – and McDonald’s was the nearest place with WiFi.Remote work and study aren’t going away after the pandemic. The internet is now a crucial public utility, essential for success in American life, and an economy where fast-food chains are the best providers of that utility is not a healthy economy. High-speed internet has to be a public good, and that’s what Build Back Better makes it. The law funds a nationwide project to connect every home to broadband.  […] And all of those are included in the bill that passed on Friday. America’s businesses will find it much easier to connect with markets abroad.”Hello everyone. This is Janet Yellen, and I want to thank UNLV for the chance to share a few thoughts today. I also want to thank the economics faculty, students, and other members of the UNLV community for sending along some very smart questions. I’m going to try to answer a few in my remarks today.But first I have to say: Your timing for this outlook conference is quite good. The past two weeks have been momentous for fiscal policymaking, easily the most consequential weeks in recent memory.On Friday night, Congress rendered a final and favorable vote on President Biden’s infrastructure bill, which will soon be signed into law. This kind of infrastructure bill – something on the scale of the project to build the Interstate Highway System – has been the ambition of lawmakers for a long, long time. Now it’s finally happened.Then, there’s a second piece of legislation, following close behind the infrastructure bill, the so-called “reconciliation bill.” This is the one that includes investments in childcare, in education, in sustainability. The House is on track to pass it later this month before The Senate takes it up.Of course, anything can happen. No legislation is final until the ink of the President’s signature is drying on the paper. But I am optimistic, and I think it is worth beginning to place this pair of laws into its proper historical context.“History” really is the right word. I’ve been involved in economic policymaking for nearly fifty years, and I’ve seen many people compare many legislative proposals to The New Deal and The Great Society. But nothing has come as close as these two pieces of legislation, which we collectively refer to as President Biden’s Build Back Better Agenda.Build Back Better is on par with past groundbreaking legislation for how significantly it will grow the economy; for how directly it will impact the everyday lives of working Americans, lowering costs and cutting taxes for them; and for the number of ways that it does these things.In fact, if you were to parse through and unpack both pieces of legislation, you’d find at least five history-making measures in their own right; the kind that only happen once every few decades, and in some cases, once every century. That’s what I want to talk about today. I can’t cover every aspect of the twin bills in our limited time together, but I do want to spend a few minutes going through each of those five historic measures and what they mean for our medium- and long-term economic outlook (as well as talking about how these measures are fully paid for).First, let’s talk about what happened on Friday night. Built Back Better is the biggest investment in American infrastructure since Eisenhower built the Interstate Highway System.There’s a somewhat famous historical anecdote about a 28-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Dwight Eisenhower and how he participated in one of the first cross-country roadtrips. This was 1919. An army convoy left Washington, DC on July 7. It reached San Francisco 62 days later, in mid-September, during which time various vehicles broke down along dirt roads, collapsed wooden bridges, and had to be towed by horses. It impressed upon the young Eisenhower that a modern economy could never be built with the current infrastructure and made him see, as he later wrote in his autobiography, “the wisdom of broader ribbons [of road] across the land.”Well, we have lived our own version of Eisenhower’s cross-country trip during the past 20 months. The pandemic has shown us that our current infrastructure is not fit for a modern economy.One of the more memorable articles I read during the pandemic was about students from Orrum, North Carolina, who would regularly drive to a McDonald’s parking lot. They’d go there to do their classwork because they were some of the millions of Americans who can’t access high-speed broadband at home – and McDonald’s was the nearest place with WiFi.Remote work and study aren’t going away after the pandemic. The internet is now a crucial public utility, essential for success in American life, and an economy where fast-food chains are the best providers of that utility is not a healthy economy. High-speed internet has to be a public good, and that’s what Build Back Better makes it. The law funds a nationwide project to connect every home to broadband.   There is ongoing debate over what qualifies as infrastructure. I won’t wade into that here, except to say that broadband unequivocally qualifies, as do investments in transit and supply chains – ports, and airports. And all of those are included in the bill that passed on Friday. America’s businesses will find it much easier to connect with markets abroad.Today, roughly half of Americans live in child care deserts,” areas where there’s only one daycare spot for every three kids. The child centers that do exist are often in disrepair, operating on razor-thin margins, with workers whose wages keep them at the edge of poverty.This is not only a profound moral failure, it is also a profound economic failure. A lack of affordable childcare has contributed to the decline in prime-age labor force participation, especially among mothers. One study found that from 2018 to 2019, 2 million parents of young children had to quit a job, not take a job, or greatly change their job because of problems with childcare.For these reasons, Build Back Better finally treats the work of caring for families as what it is: not some social issue, separate and apart from building a strong economy, but as the foundation of a strong economy. It not only ensures older Americans have access to good home care, it invests deeply in young families. The third way Build Back Better makes history is climate. These bills are our country’s largest-ever investment in reducing carbon emissions. The reconciliation bill alone contains more than half-a-trillion dollars to green our economy, while the infrastructure bill includes funding for major projects, like dotting the American landscape with 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations. We think it will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in the same way that the building of gas stations enabled cross-country travel.That is not to say Build Back Better will solve climate change, full stop, or that’s it’s final word on how this administration will fight climate change. It’s isn’t. But as far as first steps go, these are giant leaps. Altogether, Build Back Better will prevent an enormous amount of carbon from being pumped into the air – more carbon, we project, than the Amazon Rainforest sucks out of the atmosphere each year.[1]  Our goal is to halve US emissions by 2030, and these investments, we think, will get us a significant part of the way there.The fourth history-making measure is how we pay for the previous three: Build Back Better is one of the most significant tax reforms of the past half-century. It makes our tax system much fairer, in large part through a focus on compliance.America effectively has two tax systems – one for the wealthy and one for everyone else. The vast majority of Americans already pay what they owe because they get a W-2. The employer sends the IRS the same form it sends employees. Taxes are deducted from paychecks, and employees pay what they owe.But for the wealthiest Americans, who aren’t wage or salary workers and earn income via opaque ways – like proprietorships – the tax system is essentially the honor system. The government doesn’t have the equivalent of a W-2 to verify that they’re paying their full bill. This is a large part of the reason that fifteen percent of taxes owed to the federal government are not collected.We had expected that over the next decade $7 trillion dollars would fall through the cracks of our tax system in this way but Build Back Better includes $80 billion so the IRS can go after wealthy tax evaders.In the batch of questions I received ahead of this event, I saw that Professor Malamud asked about wealth tax proposals, particularly those advanced by Berkeley’ professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. While those specific proposals did not make it into the bill, the bill does make the tax code substantially more progressive. Our compliance efforts to ensure wealthy people pay what they owe will raise an estimated $400 billion – and that’s probably a conservative projection. Another $400 billion will come from closing loopholes utilized by wealthy taxpayers; and another $200 billion through a surtax on the country’s highest earners, people making more than $10 million a year.All told, we expect the revenue raising and savings provisions in the plan to generate more than $2 trillion, and they do that without raising taxes on those making less than $400,000 a year at all. In many cases, people will see a tax cut.An important piece of that $2 trillion will come from what I consider to be the fifth and final historic aspect of Build Back Better: It includes the most significant international economic agreements so far this century.More than 130 countries, representing nearly 95% of global GDP, have now agreed to change how multinational corporations are taxed, in part by imposing a minimum tax on their foreign earnings. Build Back Better would ensure that agreement is reflected in US law.Our international tax system is long overdue for an update. It was designed for the global economy as it existed in the 1920s and since then, tax competition among nations has created a beggar-thy-neighbor approach to government policy, where working and middle-class people around the world lose.  It works like this: In an attempt to lure production and business to our shores, countries, including the United States, lower corporate rates. But that tactic has a fundamental flaw: When America lowers its rates for the purpose of attracting business, other nations see it. They can lower their rates in response to undercut us – and they have. In this way, we become trapped in a global race to the bottom to see who can lower their corporate rates further and faster.The US has not won this race.  Not only do lower corporate rates ultimately fail to attract business, they erode our tax base, leaving us less revenue to invest in the core ingredients of economic growth: infrastructure, childcare, R&D.  The new tax deal pulls the United States out of this race to the bottom and enters us into a new and more productive form of competition. With a global minimum tax of at least 15 percent, there’s no incentive left for nations to try to undercut each other. Instead, nations will be forced to compete on the real metrics of strong economy: Who has the most skilled workers? The strongest infrastructure? The most cutting-edge-R&D.Peter Grema, a senior studying economics, had sent me a question about this deal: “Will a global minimum tax help address some of the wealth disparities at home?” Peter, the answer is a definite “yes” because these new competitions are ones we can win, and the revenue we generate from this tax will be re-invested in all the programs I described today to help working families.Any one of these measures would reorient our medium- to long-term economic outlook in much more positive direction, but together they do something far more transformative.One of the questions I received was from Professor Emir Malikov, who wrote, “Following the Great Recession, accelerated productivity growth was short-lived and faded away. Are you optimistic,” he asked, “[that this recovery will be] different and that we will be able to sustain higher rates of productivity growth at least in the medium term?”A few weeks ago, I would not have been as certain, but to answer the question, I am optimistic now. I do believe that the passage of these pieces of legislation will lead not only to higher rates of productivity but to positive changes across a wide array of metrics: They will increase the size of our labor force and expand the productive capacity of our economy. These investments, we expect, will lead to a GDP increase over the long-term without increasing the national debt or deficit by a dollar. In fact, the offsets in these bills mean they actually reduce annual deficits on net over time.But more important than what Build Back Better will do to macroeconomic measures is what these new laws will do to the economy as people experience it every day. About this time forty years ago, I had just started returning to work after my husband and I had our son, and I think about couples that are in a similar position right now – and what these bills might mean for them. They’ll be able to find great childcare and spend far less of their budget on it. In a few years, their kids can enter a good, free pre-school, which we know confers all sorts of benefits to kids later in life. Kids who attend pre-K tend to do better in later grades; they’re more likely to graduate high-school and college and find higher-paying jobs once they do. And those kids will live in a world where climate change is not as urgent of crisis as it is today because we made the investment to keep Earth a livable, thriving placeMore than anything else, government officials tend to invoke future generations – our children and grandchildren – as their reasons for doing things. And I don’t think it’s controversial to say that, today, many young people greet those sentiments with an eyeroll. There’s a broad feeling that past generations, having climbed the ladder, pulled it up behind them.That is the feeling, at least, and I don’t think it’s entirely unwarranted. But I do hope that these twin laws, in time, render it somewhat diminished.I hope the students of UNLV and young people across this country come to see Build Back Better for what it is – an attempt to pass forward an economy and a country with strong foundations; and that it made that generational handoff with some measure of success."
347,,"November 9, 2021","Hello everyone. This is Janet Yellen, I want to thank Secretary Raimondo and Deputy Secretary Graves for the invitation to share a few thoughts, and of course, I want to thank all of you for being here today to listen to them. I’ve been an economist for a long time, and one of the areas where I’ve always focused my attention is on the racial disparity in economic outcomes. I think it’s because I started studying the subject at the height of the civil rights movement, in 1963, when Dr. King led the March on Washington. Today, as we recover from the pandemic, that study is more urgent than ever. COVID-19 took all the pre-existing inequalities in our economy and exacerbated them. Early in the pandemic, as I’m sure this group knows well, small businesses owned by people of color tended to close first, and when our administration took office, we had found that relief measures like the Paycheck Protection Program often didn’t reach Black and Latino entrepreneurs. 
We’ve worked very hard to remedy that, and one of our efforts is a Treasury-wide equity review.  We’re looking across the Department at how we work, and asking: Where are our operations not as inclusive as they could be? Where might they have a disparate impact? And just as important, where are we leaving something on the table? Where could we be using our authority to make progress – but aren’t?A policy area of particular focus for me is Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions – CDFIs and MDIs. To reach our shared vision of more equitable growth, we must ensure that capital is flowing to the people and places that need it the most.  We need families, business owners and neighborhoods to be able to get loans and equity they need to buy homes, start and scale businesses, and revitalize communities. And we know how extremely difficult this can be for Black, Latino, Native, and Asian families and businesses. In fact, this year, the Fed conducted its annual Small Business Credit Survey, and it looked at which firms received all the non-emergency funding they sought. (They didn’t factor in economic relief funding because of COVID-19; they were trying to get a number that would be relevant outside of the pandemic). Here’s what they found: In the prior 12 months, forty percent of all white-owned firms reported receiving all of the non-emergency funding they sought. The number for Hispanic-owned firms was half that – 20 percent. Black-owned firms was about a third – 13 percent. Overall, only a quarter of minority-owned firms said they had sufficient financing. CDFIs and MDIs have proven very effective at breaking this bottleneck in the flow of capital to people and places of color. But we also know one program isn’t sufficient, and that broadening access to capital for disadvantaged communities will require a range of measures. This is a priority for our Department and for the Biden Administration as a whole. And I am excited to see that this forum has put an emphasis on areas in which the public sector can make immediate improvements. Indeed, the work of building a more equitable – especially a more racially equitable – economy cannot be just government work. It has to be a whole-of-economy effort, and we’re eager for your help. After last year’s murder of George Floyd, countless companies – including some of yours, I’m sure – made commitments totaling hundreds of billions of dollars towards anti-racism and economic empowerment efforts. Over the summer, though, I saw a report, which found that, of all the money promised, less than one percent had been distributed.My question to this group is: What can we do to get that money out there? And how can we – both your firms and our Treasury Department – work together to build an economy that is more racially equitable?  "
348,,"November 4, 2021","WASHINGTON – Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen released a statement today on the deficit reduction achieved by the Build Back Better legislation.“The Build Back Better legislation presents a historic opportunity to make investments that will cut costs for families, create good jobs, and increase economic growth for the long term. The investments and revenue provisions of the Build Back Better package would raise over $2 trillion in offsets, making the entire package paid for over ten years and would reduce deficits over the long term. By making our tax system more fair and asking the highest-income earners and big corporations to pay what they owe, Congress has put together a package that is fiscally responsible and critical to the future prosperity of our economy.”

The climate crisis is already here.  This is not a challenge for future generations, but one we must confront today.Rising to this challenge will require the wholesale transformation of our carbon-intensive economies.  It’s a global transition for which we have an estimated price tag: some have put the global figure between $100 and $150 trillion over the next three decades.  At the same time, addressing climate change is the greatest economic opportunity of our time.  Many of the conversations here in Glasgow will rightfully focus on the way we use our public resources to fund climate mitigation and adaptation activities domestically and – for those in a position to do so – to assist other countries in responding to climate change.  I agree we all must do more, and the United States is stepping up.   President Biden has already announced that we are quadrupling our international climate finance for developing countries by 2024 to more than $11 billion. This morning, as part of our continued efforts, I am pleased to join the UK in announcing that the United States also intends to fully support the Climate Investment Funds Capital Markets Mechanism.  Through an innovative leveraging structure, this initiative will help attract significant new private climate finance and provide $500 million per year for the Clean Technology Funds’ programming, including the new Accelerating Coal Transition investment program.  Partner countries should begin to quickly see the results of this support. Just yesterday President Biden announced an important partnership that the United States, UK, German, French and EU partners have developed with our South African counterparts to help South Africa design an expedited just transition to a clean and low-carbon future that supports affected communities. And later this afternoon I will be speaking specifically on what we are doing to mobilize climate finance to emerging and developing economies, including our engagement with the multilateral development banks and institutions.  I hope you will join me to hear more.These programs are exciting.  But as big as the public sector effort is across all our countries, the $100-trillion plus price tag to address climate change globally is far bigger.  The gap between what governments have and what the world needs is large, and the private sector needs to play a bigger role.   The old notions of why the private sector should decarbonize – because planet must be put before profit – are no longer universally true.  Many renewables are now cheaper than carbon-based fuel alternatives and have lower long-term operating costs.  Other green technologies have cost curves that continue to plunge.  In many cases, it is simply cost effective to go green.The private sector is ready to supply the financing to set us on a course to avoid the worst effects of climate change.  CEOs representing trillions in assets are here to show their commitment.  Financial institutions with collective assets under management of nearly $100 trillion have come together under The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, or GFANZ.  If these ambitions are realized, those portfolios will be carbon-neutral by 2050 and significantly reduce emissions by 2030. Questions remain, however: Will enough investment opportunities materialize to absorb all this capital?  How quickly can this reorientation occur?  And how can institutions transparently report on their commitments so we can hold each other to account on transition plans?There are a number of actions governments can take to make sure the answers to these questions keep us on a path to net-zero.  First, we have an essential responsibility to ensure the resiliency of the financial system to climate-related risks.  That is why in May, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Climate-related Financial Risks.  In response to that Order, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which I Chair, produced a report last month on these risks and U.S. regulators’ role in addressing them. This includes actions to enhance climate-related data and disclosures to improve the information available to investors, market participants, and regulators.  The report’s recommendations represent a significant and vital step towards making the U.S. financial system more resilient to the threat of climate change.  We’re working with our partners at the Financial Stability Board and elsewhere to support similar efforts on a global scale.Next, we need to enhance the transparency and climate-resiliency of our infrastructure projects. Private sector investors frequently note the challenges of inadequate data to assess risk, insufficient risk-adjusted returns in the initial project phase, and a lack of bankable projects.  That is why we strongly support efforts to operationalize the G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment. These efforts to identify risks must be complemented by measures to help identify opportunities to invest in the firms and technologies that will move us towards decarbonization.  And so we have taken a number of actions domestically to clear the way for private capital to support our own transition to a green economy. This includes outlining a path forward to make vast swaths of public waters available for leasing to build 30 gigawatts of offshore wind-power by 2030.  That, I think, sends, a strong signal of policy support to investors looking to deploy climate-aligned capital.As we meet here in Glasgow, a large infrastructure bill is moving through the United States Congress.  It includes enough funding to dot the American landscape with almost 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, which will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles.  President Biden has also proposed a number of tax credits that we expect will incentivize the buildout of high-voltage capacity power lines and renewable energy generation capacity.  We anticipate that they will mobilize tens of billions of dollars in private capital right away.If all countries come to Glasgow prepared to do their part, COP26 can be a turning point that sets the world on the right course for this decisive decade.  We still have a lot of work to do, but I am committed to the task and I know you are as well."
350,,"November 1, 2021","Of course, I want to thank Minister Donohoe, too, for your warm welcome – but most of all, thank you for your friendship and your honest counsel these past several months. I have more to say about that in a moment, but for now, to all of you present here, as they say here in Ireland, “Dia daoibh.This is my first visit to Ireland as Secretary of the Treasury, and I have enjoyed every minute of my stay in Dublin so far.  My only regret is that I am only here for such a short time.Our two nations – Ireland and America – share much in common, not least that both our governments are currently run by Irishmen. President Biden, as this audience may know, is proud of his roots here.It is not an uncommon affection. Every tenth American is an Irish American, and the people that Ireland gave to America gave their ideas back to the world.  The story of Ireland and America is the centuries old story of transatlantic exchange – the cross-migration of people and commerce.Today, hundreds of U.S. companies make Ireland their European and international headquarters, and many of these U.S. companies have even been in Ireland so long that some people are surprised to learn they’re not Irish. Moreover, despite its small size, today Ireland is an important source of foreign direct investment to the United States. And not only are Irish firms a source of investment into the U.S., they are a source of employment in the U.S. too.  U.S.-Irish trade and investment is a two-way bridge that has and continues to benefit both countries tremendously. Alongside this deep bilateral trade and investment relationship, the U.S. and Ireland also cooperate on a wide array of economic and financial topics, including responding to the pandemic and setting the stage for a sustained global economic recovery.Our two nations share a rich and storied past and have an important friendship today – but that is not why I am here. I am here because of how our two nations have recently agreed to help create a stronger, more sustainable, and more equitable global economy.On October 8, a new era of multilateralism began in international tax – one that is aimed at serving the interest of everyday workers and families. 136 countries – Ireland and the U.S. included – agreed to modernize the laws of global commerce. For the first time in a century, nearly 95% of the world’s GDP has decided that we’re changing how corporations are taxed internationally, in part by imposing a minimum tax on corporate foreign earnings.The agreement also includes strong provisions that will buttress and police the system, incentivizing countries to join and remain within it, helping to sustain minimum taxes around the world.What does this mean for the world? For Ireland? For the U.S.? And for our relationship that has spanned the ocean and the centuries? That is what I would like to discuss here.The best place to begin is by saying this wasn’t destined to happen. It is hard to change the world with the inertia of a century’s worth of history, and up until this moment, we lived with an international tax regime that was designed for the world as it existed in the 1920s.Ireland and the U.S. were so much farther apart then. Every nation was. You could barely travel from New York to Dublin in under a week. If you wanted to send a message between the two cities, the fastest way to do it was via telegram, which would be sent by cable up through the Canadian border, where a clerk would transmit the message by way of Marconi Wireless to London and then here.All this is to say, back then no one conceived of multinational corporations as they currently exist, or the global economy as it currently operates. But then, of course, the 20th century happened. Innovation accelerated. Corporations grew bigger and gained more market power while competition for mobile capital heated up. Borders became permeable. The planet got smaller. As the world changed, the international tax rules largely did not, leading countries and companies to interact in unintended ways which led to a race to the bottom in corporate taxation.The race to the bottom has deprived our nations of the funding they needed to invest in themselves. In Ireland, as elsewhere, companies often paid much less than even a low corporate headline tax rate would suggest.Tax competition among nations had created a beggar-thy-neighbor approach to government policy, where working and middle-class people around the world lost and no country could win in the long-term.The system could not hold, and so the world began negotiations to change it. And now we’ve designed a new system – and a strong global minimum tax – that will serve the interests of everyday families and workers.This global system, with its multilateral enforcement tools, will help ensure that large multinational corporations pay their fair share in Ireland, just as they will in the rest of the world. In so doing, it will provide greater social resources to ensure our citizens have access to childcare, education, and health, improving their lives substantially.This system can enter all nations into a new and more productive form of competition. Instead of asking, “Who can offer the lowest tax rate?,” it will allow us to ask, “Which nation can offer the best physical and technological infrastructure, and most importantly, the most talented workers?.” In other words, we will compete on the basis of economic fundamentals.Ireland’s competitive edge has long been far more than just a low corporate tax rate.  Ireland is “Exhibit A” of a country investing in human capital and creating the necessary business ecosystem for sustained growth.However, perception often lags behind reality. Minister Donohoe and I have met several times this past year, and he helped me better understand just how “totemic” Ireland’s corporate rate is.Yet Ireland’s investment in public education has created one of the world’s most educated workforces. A globally recognized brand of business certainty and friendliness, based on rule-of-law principles and institutions, has made Ireland a place companies want to be based.Although Ireland is small, it is one of the U.S.’s closest allies.  We know we can rely on Ireland be our ally not just in the world, but in Europe, and the United States’ values Ireland’s role as a bridge between the U.S. and the EU.   Meanwhile, one just has to walk along Dublin’s “Silicon Docks” to see your success is founded on positive non-tax benefits.  Ireland is a place where real businesses center major activities; it has become one of the most attractive places in Europe to center the EU operations for many of the U.S.’s most innovative companies. It has always been Ireland’s openness, legal certainty, and conducive business culture that helped bring those companies to these shores. Those features can and will ensure continued success for Ireland.But it’s never easy to make a seismic change; and Ireland’s support for this agreement is critical. And we view this agreement as a once in a generation event and change.We deeply appreciate Ireland’s ability to adapt to a changing international tax environment.  We look forward to continuing our partnership in other areas, not least the inviolability of the Good Friday Agreement.The global economy will only thrive by leveling the playing field for businesses and encouraging countries to compete on a positive basis. And that’s also why we are moving forward with international tax reform at home and working to go first to implement the global minimum tax in our upcoming reconciliation legislation, helping to lead the world to this better and more secure corporate international tax system.I am proud of the new international tax deal because it not only provides benefits for everyday families, it will also stabilize the century-old international tax system.Importantly, the deal ends the chaotic array of digital services taxes that have discriminated against Irish and US companies. This should put an end to tax and trade disputes that could otherwise hamper economic growth and business investment.  And it does so in a way that addresses the growing dissatisfaction that had arisen with a set of rules and norms that failed to account for the fact that with modern technology, companies in a wide variety of sectors can be deeply involved in economies where they do not have headquarters or physical operations. The new reallocation of taxing rights under the agreement instead recognizes that in the modern economy, a business can be meaningfully involved in the economic life of a jurisdiction without having physical presence in that jurisdiction.   The new international tax deal will also achieve a fairer balance of the revenue needs of all nations. This will, in turn, ensure that the new rules endure, providing much needed tax certainty to taxpayers and corporations around the world.And so, now all countries move forward together, just as they have in the past – with one important difference. We are not pitted against one another anymore. For the United States to prosper, our neighbors and friends too must prosper.  In the modern world, recession and instability find ways to wash upon our shore.  Strong and stable economies abroad make us safer.We also emerge, I believe, with a greater reservoir of hope – hope about what can be accomplished on the world stage. Of course, this deal is a harbinger of good things for the Irish-American relationship. Ireland may be small. But it is large in the American heart and the American mind. You are among our closest allies, and we rely on you to be a bridge to the EU.But this deal is also a signifier of our two nations’ relationships with the wider world. There is no large problem in the 21st century that will not require some semblance of multilateralism. Climate change, ending the pandemic, the effort for equality and dignity for all people – all of it will take some form of concerted action, and this deal bodes well for that. Tax, after all, is neither uncontroversial nor uncomplicated. If we can find agreement on this, then what else can we find agreement on?Let me close by saying this: President Biden is not the only one with an affinity for Irish poets. I developed a great passion for literature in high school. At that time, one of the world’s most notable playwrights was Samuel Beckett, who I understand was born in Foxrock and educated at Trinity. “Let us do something,” Beckett wrote, “Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed…  Let us make the most of it, before it is too late! Let us represent worthily for one the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you say?”And to conclude, I want to personally thank and applaud the leadership by your Finance Minister and government for making the hard and brave decision to join the United States and 134 other countries in supporting this unprecedented international framework agreement."
351,,"November 1, 2021","As prepared for delivery

I want to thank the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, for hosting us, and of course, I want to thank Minister Donohoe, for your warm introduction – and, more than that, for your friendship and honest counsel over the past ten months.

As with administrations before it, the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to preserving and strengthening the U.S.-Irish bond, between our governments and between our people.

And these ties extend to our businesses as well. Today, over 900 U.S. companies have established roots here – with many making Ireland their European and international headquarters.

As this group knows well, these U.S. companies directly employ over 180,000 people in Ireland and another 140,000 indirectly, while investing around $6 billion in capital expenditures in Ireland every year. U.S.-Irish trade and investment is a two-way bridge that continues to benefit both countries tremendously.

This strong partnership between our countries has proven absolutely necessary in understanding each others’ positions in the recent negotiations on international tax.

As we all know, on October 8, in a remarkable testament to both the potential of multilateral cooperation among nations, and the vision of countries like Ireland to adapt to a changing world, 136 countries – representing nearly 95% of the world’s GDP – agreed to rewrite the international tax rules to impose a 15% global minimum tax on corporate foreign earnings, thereby taking a once-in-a-generation step that will end the race to the bottom on corporate taxes.

Minister Donohoe – I remember how during one of our first meetings you told me that I could walk down Grafton street and ask any Irish person, “What’s your country’s corporate tax rate?” – and I would very likely get the correct answer. 

Minister Donohoe, you’ve helped me understand how the corporate tax rate is a touchstone issue here in a way that it isn’t almost anywhere in the world.

But what I’ve found more remarkable these past few months, is Ireland’s capacity to adapt. Indeed, I think it’s a testament not only to you, Minister Donohoe – but to the Irish people – that you saw the world for what it was, where it was headed, and what it needed, and therefore saw that it was time for change. 

Countries agreed that the post-pandemic world must be fairer, especially with regard to international taxation. We understood the need to have stable tax systems that provide strong incentives for businesses to invest while raising sufficient revenue that allow us all to invest in essential public goods, respond to crises, and ensure that all citizens and corporations fairly share the burden of financing government.

The OECD/G20 international tax agreement includes strong provisions that will buttress and police the system, incentivizing countries to join and remain within it, and helping to sustain minimum taxes around the world.

And under this global system, with its multilateral enforcement tools, large multinational corporations will pay their fair share in Ireland, just as they will in the rest of the world.

And through this process, Minister Donohoe, your leadership on behalf of Ireland to ensure it was not left behind in this process has frankly been extraordinary.

So the United States and over 130 other countries are truly grateful that Ireland came forward to support the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework Agreement. The agreement will help ensure fairness for middle class and working people not just in Ireland and the United States, but around the world.

And it will help the global economy thrive by leveling the playing field for businesses and encouraging positive competition among countries, competition judged by the talent and education of a nation’s workforce and the quality of its physical and technological infrastructure.

And, indeed, the global minimum tax will help fund investments in those critical priorities.

With its robust business environment, Ireland is already winning this new race to the top. 

That is some of what this agreement will do for the whole world, including Ireland. But of course, the crucial question in this audience, “What will it do for Ireland in particular?”

Well, here is my honest assessment of what it WILL NOT do: It won’t change this country’s status as one of the best places to do business in the world.

As I mentioned, there are hundreds of U.S. companies with real roots in Ireland. Was the corporate tax rate one reason they came? I would have to imagine yes. But it was not the only reason, and it wasn’t the reason they stayed, or the main reason they are here now.

And I and my Treasury colleagues hear that regularly. You are here because of the caliber of the workforce, the strength of the business environment. This deal doesn’t change any of that. 

In fact, this new tax deal will bring certainty to your companies, including those which have been challenged in recent years by a chaotic array of unilateral digital tax measures, in a context in which the status quo simply could not be maintained.

Rather than acting in a world of tax uncertainty, when this deal is fully implemented, companies will again be able to plan and make investment decisions in a more stable environment.

We thus appreciate Ireland’s partnership in getting this agreement over the line. And the United States will also continue to be a reliable partner on the wide array of economic and financial topics that provide benefits to business.

And we will work together to achieve a sustained and equitable global economic recovery from the pandemic, and continue to cooperate in addressing an array of transatlantic and global economic and financial issues.

President Biden likes to quote Irish poets and while it turns out Seamus Heaney and Yeats didn’t write much verse about international tax regimes, they did write often about friendship. “Think where man’s glory most begins and ends,” Yeats wrote, “and say my glory was I had such friends.""

It is the United States’ great fortune to have a friend such as Ireland. And I think that all of our companies, on both sides of the Atlantic, will continue to benefit from that friendship for many, many years to come. 

I look forward to hearing from the business community represented here today, your perspective on the international tax agreement, and how we can ensure it is implemented in a manner that benefits governments, businesses, and the wider public. "

He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
353,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
354,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

356,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
357,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3. The Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG) is composed of staff from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  I would also like to thank Sam Schulhofer-Wohl and colleagues from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas for their help in producing this report.4.

I am delighted to be here in Ireland, my first visit to the country as the United States Treasury Secretary. This is a special visit for me, highlighting the strong bond our two countries continue to share. A bond built on strong economic and cultural ties. A bond the United States is committed to preserving.

I would like to thank Minister Donohoe for his warm welcome on my first stop in Dublin. We had a constructive meeting, focused on our close economic relationship and how together – through economic diplomacy – the United States and Ireland are helping to stabilize the international tax system.

The Biden-Harris Administration is grateful, and I am personally thankful, for the stewardship of both the Taoiseach and Minister Donohoe during the OECD Inclusive Framework negotiations.

Ireland has joined 135 other countries – representing nearly 95% of the global economy – in agreeing to a new set of international tax rules, including a global minimum tax.

This is a historic, once-in-a-generation global agreement that will support efforts to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth in all our economies.

Later, we will have a chance to hear from the business community in Ireland, where U.S. firms play a strong role.

American companies have flocked to Ireland thanks to a welcoming, efficient, and stable business environment; its well-educated workforce; and thanks to Ireland’s position in the EU. These factors will continue to make Ireland one of the most open and attractive places in Europe in which to do business.

Stable and prudent economic management also makes Ireland attractive to the private sector, both domestic and foreign. Throughout the pandemic, the Irish government has effectively guided the economy to reduce the negative impact of strict lockdown policies. The success of these policies shows in strong economic growth this year.

Thank you again, Minister Donohoe, and thanks to the people of Ireland, for hosting me. I look forward to a productive set of engagements during my trip and strengthening the already strong bond between the United States and Ireland.

“Any one of the proposals contained in this framework – childcare, climate change investments, universal pre-K – would be a remarkable achievement, but together, they represent something truly historic: a new period of investment in economic growth for all Americans across the country.
 
This package, alongside the infrastructure package, will change the shape of the American economy for the better and the way people experience it every day. Among many other things, these policies will lower household costs for healthcare and childcare, increase labor force participation and lift the upper limit on how productive and prosperous our economy can be. They will also let parents connect through faster broadband, find higher-paying jobs, and drive on good roads to get to them.
 The measures announced today also make our tax system fairer and level the playing field for workers and small business. By increasing tax enforcement, we will begin to close the multi-trillion dollar tax gap that deprives our country of revenue and allows those at the top to avoid paying what they owe. And it includes critical steps to end the global race to the bottom on corporate taxes — an essential commitment as we engage this week with our counterparts from around the world.
 I am grateful to Members of Congress for negotiating in good faith to reach this moment and congratulate President Biden on this crucial step forward.”"

I think it’s worth taking a few minutes to place this body of work into the proper historical context. This Council, as we well know, was established in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis with the goal of preventing such a crisis from ever occurring again.  Over the past decade, we have made meaningful progress, building the oversight infrastructure to protect against another such event.  But as the maxim goes, we cannot simply “fight the last war.” We must look forward – that is our responsibility under the Dodd-Frank Act, which gave this Council the duty to respond to emerging threats to the stability of the United States financial system.

Today, we are recognizing a unique, existential risk for the planet that will affect every aspect of our lives and the lives of our children—including through effects on the financial sector.  It does not require a vivid imagination to see how climate change could threaten the financial system.  As climate change intensifies, more frequent and severe climate-related events—wildfires, tropical storms, and flooding, for example—could trigger declines in asset values and economic activity that could cascade through the financial system, especially if such risks are not properly measured and mitigated.  Moreover, the economic adjustments required to address climate change are large and need to begin soon, including through smart government policies to facilitate the transition to a net-zero economy.  If such policies are delayed and later implemented in an abrupt, disorderly fashion, a rapid revision of perceptions could lead to  sudden and dramatic effects on economic activity and asset values.  The longer we wait to address the underlying causes of climate change, the greater this risk.

The responsibility of this Council is to ensure the resilience of the financial system to the future impacts of climate change.  We have identified climate change as an emerging threat to the financial stability of the United States.  But we must be crystal clear that an emerging threat is not the same as a hypothetical one, and it would be foolish to confuse the two. 

It is challenging to predict the future impacts of climate change precisely, but we know that climate change has already started causing an array of economic harms, and failure to address climate-related financial risks will only allow them to grow larger.

Indeed, the costs of climate change are increasingly impacting household’s expenses, income, and homes as well as corporate balance sheets.  As we were drafting this report, Hurricane Ida tore through the middle of the country, displacing thousands of people in small, rural towns and leaving New Orleans without power for an extended period.  And this was unfortunately only one example of extreme weather events, almost surely tied to climate change, that we witnessed over the few months during which we drafted the report.  We also saw a record heatwave in the Pacific Northwest.  Wildfires tore across the American West to a degree unimaginable to many of us just a few years ago.  

The events of this summer are an all-too-unfortunate reminder of why today’s report is critical.  The report makes recommendations for how Council member agencies can more effectively respond to these particular climate-related risks – what we term “the physical risks” – as well as the transition risks of the necessary shift to a lower-carbon economy.  In total, the report contains over 30 specific recommendations, but generally speaking, they fall into four main areas:
It’s important to note that this report is not exhaustive.  Nor is it the final word from the Council on this urgent priority.  Instead, it is just a first step.  As our capacity to respond to climate change increases – as our base of information expands and our reservoir of expertise deepens – we expect to formulate new strategies to address this emerging threat to financial stability. 

Finally, I should stress that our most financially stable future is our most environmentally sustainable future, one where we’ve transitioned to a low-carbon economy.  Many institutions and individuals – in and out of government – are tasked with facilitating that future.  I would add, on a personal note, that I consider myself one of them: As Chair of this Council, as Secretary of the Treasury, and as a resident of this planet, I believe it is my task to hand down a livable and financially prosperous world to future generations.  I know many of you feel the same.  And I am hopeful that future generations will favorably judge our efforts. 

Thank you."
361,,"October 12, 2021","Hello, everyone. I’m Janet Yellen, the United States Treasury Secretary. I want to thank Vice President Gore for the invitation and for his many years of leadership on this issue. We’re now three weeks out on the road to Glasgow, and it’s a road crowded with many different travelers. A generation ago, the road, so to speak, was a much lonelier place, deserted by comparison. There was a cohort of environmental activists and government officials, like Vice President Gore, who cared deeply about climate change, but it was nothing like the broad cross-section of leaders that will descend on Glasgow at the end of October: representatives of nearly every country and sector, including this audience from the financial sectorThis is a welcome development. After all, climate change has to be understood, in part, as an economic problem, as a financial challenge. In some ways, it can be distilled into basic arithmetic. Averting a climate crisis requires that we limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and that, in turn, requires the wholesale transformation of our carbon-powered global economy. It’s a project for which we have an estimated price tag: Some have put the global figure between $100 and 150 trillion over the next three decades.  Many nations, the United States included, are now devoting vast resources to facilitate this transformation. Governments representing three-quarters of global GDP have pledged to make their economies net-zero by mid-century. And yet, as big as this public sector effort is, the $100-trillion price tag is far bigger. The gap between what governments have and what the world needs is large, and it must be filled by others, which is to say the private sector.  Climate change isn’t the moon landing, a project that can be led exclusively by government. If we had to make a comparison, it’s more like the recent effort to fight the pandemic, a global endeavor comprised of a constellation of actors; one that extends from the tops of governments and corporations to the terminuses of supply chains and requires the resources of every organization along the way. This is true for both developed and emerging market nations.  Of course, we are not talking about the private sector acting against its own interests. I suspect this group knows that better than anybody. The old notions of why the private sector should decarbonize – because planet must be put before profit – are much less true than they used to be.  Many renewables are now cheaper than carbon-based fuels. Other green technologies have cost curves that continue to plunge. For these reasons, financial institutions are shifting their portfolios to green investments. The Glasgow Financial Network for Net-zero, or GFANZ, now includes institutions with a collective assets under management that are fast approaching $100 trillion. Per the ambitions of GFANZ, those portfolios will be carbon-neutral by 2050 and significantly reduce emissions by 2030. The question remains, however: Will enough investment opportunities materialize to absorb all this capital? How quickly can this reorientation occur? And will the capital flow to developing countries where the need for investment is often highest?That’s what I expect future generations to judge us on. When they look back at government leaders in this time, they will look both at how deeply we dug into public coffers to address climate change, and at how well we incentivized the private sector to dig into their accounts. Did we do a good job encouraging the private sector to begin reorienting its investment activities toward a net-zero posture? There are a number of measures governments can take to ensure the future judges us favorably by these measures. In the United States, the actions we’re taking, broadly speaking, fall into five categories. First is public investment in the foundational infrastructure for a green economy. As I record this video, a large infrastructure bill is moving through the United States Congress. It includes enough funding to dot the American landscape with 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, which will accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles in the same way that the building of gas stations encouraged cross-country travel. Moreover, incentivizing the expansion of the American electric vehicle market is a smart idea with the growing number of companies that have announced dates by which they will stop producing internal combustion engines. Second, governments catalyze private investment with tax and budget policymaking. For example, President Biden has proposed an investment tax credit that we expect will incentivize the buildout of at least 20 gigawatts of high-voltage capacity power lines. We anticipate that it will mobilize tens of billions of dollars in private capital right away. Third, the public sector can invest in basic research. Before the internet was commercially viable, it was incubated at institutions like ARPA. Government can play a similar role in shepherding nascent technologies like green hydrogen and carbon capture, helping turn them into investable opportunities. Our administration has proposed funding for that, as well. Fourth involves mobilizing more climate finance in emerging economies. Since July, the United States has doubled our international climate finance pledge, and we’re making sure that those public funds go as far as possible. We want them matched by private co-investment. I have convened multilateral development bank leaders twice already to ensure their goals are aligned with the Paris Agreement and to set strong private sector investment-mobilization targets.Finally, governments can help create transparency across financial markets, ensuring investors know what they need to know to make investments that are green and avoid ones that aren’t. One of the financial sector’s most essential functions is the distribution of risk—ensuring that it falls across investors and institutions well placed to manage it. Climate change is introducing new types of risks: risks from more frequent and severe natural disasters, the so-called physical risks; and the transition risks, the ones that accompany the technological, market, and policy changes needed to address climate change.  Climate-related risks to the financial system are generally challenging to measure and assess.  Financial regulators in the United States and internationally are working hard to develop the data and methods necessary to assess these risks and to ensure the financial system is resilient to them.  I chair the Financial Stability Oversight Council – or FSOC – which is a group of independent financial regulators.  In the next few weeks, I expect that FSOC will issue a report reviewing current approaches to incorporate climate-related financial risk into regulatory and supervisory activities It will discuss how climate-related disclosures can be enhanced and look at processes to identify climate-related financial risks to U.S. financial stability.  I remember giving my first speech on the subject of climate change. This was March of 1998. The U.S. Congress was holding hearings on the Kyoto Protocol, and the Clinton Administration needed a White House official to testify. I raised my hand.I told Congress to think of Kyoto as a form of planetary insurance. Wouldn’t even a significant investment in transitioning our economies away from carbon be worth it if it saved entire species and priceless coastal cities? If it helped ensure that we kept the world livable? It’s now 23 years later, and of course, the insurance analogy still stands. Investments in a low-carbon economy are still good preventative measures, hedges against a terrible future. But they’re also more than that; they’re good investments not only in terms of the disasters they prevent, but the growth they create.  That’s increasingly clear now. The flow of capital from carbon-intensive to carbon-neutral investments is probably the most dramatic and predictable economic shift in human history. The transition is happening already. And the United States intends not only to lead it, but to speed it up; to give the private sector all the information and motivation it needs to contribute to building a green economy and save our world. "
362,,"July 30, 2021","The United States welcomes the EU’s adoption today of a new sanctions regime to promote accountability and reform in Lebanon.  As an increasing number of Lebanese suffer from the country’s worsening economic crisis, it is critical that Lebanese leaders heed their people’s repeated calls for an end to widespread corruption and government inaction and form a government that can initiate the reforms critical to address the country’s dire situation.  Sanctions are intended, among other things, to compel changes in behavior, and promote accountability for corrupt actors and leaders who have engaged in malign behavior.  We welcome the EU’s use of this powerful tool to promote accountability on a global scale. The United States looks forward to future cooperation with the EU in our shared efforts."
363,,"July 1, 2021","Today is an historic day for economic diplomacy. For decades, the United States has participated in a self-defeating international tax competition, lowering our corporate tax rates only to watch other nations lower theirs in response. The result was a global race to the bottom: Who could lower their corporate rate further and faster?
 
No nation has won this race. Lower tax rates have not only failed to attract new businesses, they have also deprived countries of funding for important investments like infrastructure, education, and efforts to combat the pandemic. In the United States, this agreement will ensure that corporations shoulder a fair share of that burden. 
 
Today’s agreement by 130 countries representing more than 90 percent of global GDP is a clear sign: the race to the bottom is one step closer to coming to an end. In its place, America will enter a competition that we can win; one judged on the skill of our workers and the strength of our infrastructure. We have a chance now to build a global and domestic tax system that lets American workers and businesses compete and win in the world economy.
 
President Biden has spoken about a “foreign policy for the middle class,” and today’s agreement is what that looks like in practice. "
364,,"June 16, 2021","When I took office back in January, the first – and most urgent – problem confronting our economy was obviously the pandemic: helping people make it to the other side of the crisis and ensuring they were met there by a robust recovery. Thanks to this Congress – and its passage of the American Rescue Plan – I believe we are well on our way towards that goal.But we have to be clear-eyed about something: The pandemic was not our only economic problem.  Long before a single American was infected with COVID-19, millions of people in this country were running up against a series of long-term, structural economic challenges that undermined their ability to make a good living. For instance, wage inequality. In healthy economies, we see wage growth across the distribution – for workers making the highest incomes and those making the lowest. But over the past several decades, that has not been the case in our economy. While the highest earners have seen their income grow, families at the bottom end of the distribution have seen their pay stagnate.  Gender and racial pay gaps also persist.At the same time, labor force participation has been dropping. Even before the pandemic, the share of American women in the workforce lagged far behind many other wealthy nations.These trends have coincided with a reordering of the economic map. There have always been richer areas of the country and poorer areas, but for most of the 20th century, the latter were catching up with the former. The country was rising together. Today, this is less true. There’s a divergence among local economies, some areas that are growing more prosperous and others that are stagnating.And of course, there is racial inequality: When I started studying economics in 1963, the average Black family’s wealth was about 15% of the average white family. Maybe that isn’t surprising: Jim Crow laws were still in effect. But what is surprising is that it’s almost 60 years later, and that ratio has barely changed.These destructive forces – the divergence in wages and of geographic regions, the decline in labor force participation, the rise of climate change, and the persistence of racial inequality – all these are combining to block tens of millions of Americans from the prosperous parts of our economy.There are clear reasons why these destructive forces have festered. The private sector does not make enough of the types of investments needed to reverse them – training programs that can lead to higher wages; childcare and paid leave that would help people rejoin the workforce; or  infrastructure that would lower carbon emissions and spur growth in neglected communities. For 40 years we haven’t done that. Not as much as we should have.We need to remedy this lack of investment. We need ambitious fiscal policy to start unwinding these trends, and if there is a short summary of the President’s Budget, that’s it. The Budget, which includes both the American Jobs and Families Plans, will repair the fractured foundations of our economy. It does so through a series of smart policies, including childcare and paid leave so more parents can join the workforce; a mass modernization – and greening – of America’s infrastructure to spur commerce and reduce emissions; an investment to make housing and education available to all.  The list goes on.We need to make these investments at some point, and now is fiscally the most strategic time to make them. We expect the cost of federal debt payments will remain well below historical levels through the coming decade. We have a window to invest in ourselves.In fact, this Budget is both fiscally strategic and fiscally responsible. It pays for itself through a long overdue reformation of the tax code that will make it fairer, without touching the vast majority of Americans, those who earn less than $400,000 a year."
365,,"June 15, 2021","As the Vice President mentioned, today Treasury is awarding $1.25 billion to 863 Community Development Financial Institutions across the country. These CDFIs, which include banks, credit unions, and loan funds, play such an important part in our financial services ecosystem because they serve people and places the sector hasn’t traditionally served well. About 20 percent of CDFIs are headquartered in what are termed, “persistent poverty counties,” and about 40 percent are headquartered in majority-minority areas – communities of color – where they make loans to help people start businesses or buy homes.The Vice President is right. This is one of the first subjects she raised with me – the importance of CDFIs – and it’s exactly the right place to focus our attention. Because these questions – “Who can access credit and capital? And who can’t” – are at the root of many long-term structural problems in our economy.For most of the 20th century, our economy was undergoing a convergence. There were richer areas of the country, and poorer areas, but the latter were catching up with the former. The country was rising together. Today, this is less true. There’s a divergence among local economies, and one of the trends we see is that some places don’t have access to much capital while others have an abundance. In fact, some forms of investment are heavily concentrated within just a handful of cities. Last year, for instance, 71 percent of all venture funding went to just four metropolitan areas.This disparity in who can access capital also falls along racial lines.  About 16 percent of America’s population lives in areas that are majority minority areas, but that 16 percent of the population only receives about 9 percent of investment from mainstream financial institutions. Indeed, it’s part of the reason the racial wealth gap persists. When I started studying economics in 1963, the average Black family owned 15 percent of what the average white family owned, and that number hasn’t changed in half a century. It’s as close to a constant as we come in economic data.This is a very unjust aspect of our economy. The Vice President made that very clear. But I would also add: It’s a very unhealthy aspect of our economy. If you were designing a well-functioning American economy, you wouldn’t have 70  percent of capital (in any form) flowing to just four cities. Because that’s not where 70 percent of the opportunity is.We – as a country – are missing out on so many avenues for growth because our capital is bottlenecked by race and region. Research has shown that decreasing barriers faced by African Americans would produce substantial GDP gains.This is why, even if you never apply for a loan from a Community Development Financial Institution, you should care about them. Because in serving places that the financial sector historically hasn’t served well, they lift our whole economy up. By one measure, every dollar injected into a CDFI catalyzes eight more dollars in private-sector investment, meaning that today’s announcement might lead to an additional $10 billion in investment.  I know the President and the Vice President ran on a very ambitious agenda – “Build Back Better,” unwinding systemic racism, creating an economy that works for everyone. I believe this is what that looks like in practice. By channeling more capital into CDFIs, we are translating those ideals into reality. And this is just the beginning. The $12 billion Treasury is now allocating for community lenders is more funding than has flowed through the CDFI Fund since its creation in the ‘90s.With that, I want to thank the entire CDFI team that has made today’s announcement possible, and I want to echo the Vice President’s thanks to all the members of Congress who helped get this done, especially Senator Warner and Chairwoman Waters – and also Leader Schumer, Chairman Brown, and Senator Booker."
366,,"June 11, 2021","The Council first discussed the importance of reference rate reform in 2012, and a great deal of progress has been made since then.  The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, has worked to identify and address transition issues, including analysis of potential alternative rates and the recommendation to use the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR.  SOFR provides a robust rate, suitable for use in most products and with underlying transaction volumes that are unmatched by other LIBOR alternatives.The ARRC has also addressed other issues, including drafting clear and effective contractual fallbacks to alternative rates upon LIBOR’s cessation; facilitating the development of SOFR derivatives markets; developing conventions for the use of SOFR across asset classes; and proposing legislation, which New York State recently enacted, to help transition certain legacy contracts.Despite this progress, we have reached a critical juncture, and more must be done to facilitate an orderly transition.  With U.S. dollar LIBOR’s cessation dates fully known, many market participants are actively evaluating their options and undertaking the work to transition contracts.  While important progress is being made in some segments of the market, other segments, including business loans, are well behind where they should be at this stage in the transition.The decisions made now around the selection of alternative rates will determine whether some of LIBOR’s shortcomings may be replicated through the use of alternative rates that lack sufficient underlying transaction volumes.  I am concerned about recent use, and potential future growth in use, of these rates in derivatives, where the volume of derivatives contracts referencing these alternative rates could quickly outnumber the transaction volumes underlying the reference rate, leaving it vulnerable to manipulation and disruption – one of the primary issues with LIBOR.Additionally, I understand the desire of some market participants for a forward-looking SOFR term rate, as it would provide a useful additional tool in the transition away from LIBOR.  I encourage market participants to act promptly to support the switch in derivatives from LIBOR to SOFR this summer, as suggested by the CFTC’s benchmark subcommittee on benchmark reform and the ARRC. It is important for term SOFR to be grounded in a deep SOFR derivatives market and to be used in a way that does not diminish that activity.  Action by market participants now will allow the ARRC to recommend a term SOFR rate quite soon.The most critical step in the transition is the move toward truly robust alternative rates, like SOFR, which can mitigate the need for future transitions.  A failure to adopt robust alternative rates would leave us continuing to face the same risks and challenges that we face today."
367,,"June 7, 2021","As prepared for pre-recorded video

Hello. It’s wonderful to join you to today. I want to thank the Secretary Raimondo and the Commerce Department for inviting me to say a few words about the US economy – and where our administration would like to guide it in the coming years.
 As you’re likely aware, our economy is in the midst of a rapid transition. With more and more Americans vaccinated, and more businesses resuming normal operations every day, our economy is returning to its pre-pandemic state.
 Increasingly, the question we are asking is not: What will the economy look like in 2022? By next year, I expect our economy to be back at full employment, in large part because we’ve provided an historic amount of relief to both families and businesses.

Instead, the questions we’re asking are: What will the economy look like in 2023? In 2024? In the years beyond?
 I know many in this audience are asking similar questions. When investors and managers decide where to put their resources, they do so with a long-term vision. I want you to know: The Biden Administration takes the same long-term view. Our goal is to cement America’s status, for decades to come, as the world’s most attractive place for firms to put down roots, to scale up, and to hire workers. To do this, we have proposed historic changes to the status quo.
 Since the 1980s, our nation has seen declining investment in public goods: infrastructure, education and training, childcare. The impact on private sector competitiveness cannot be denied. When people can’t find a way to raise their children without staying home, they don’t participate in the labor force. This is why our female labor force participation rate was hovering near where it was in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. To reverse these four decades of under-investment in public goods, the President proposed two plans: the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan.
 The Jobs Plan would implement a range of productivity and profitability-boosting public investments totaling $2.2 trillion over the coming ten years—about three-quarters of one percent of GDP—a large number but an achievable one.
 That funding will be used to build and modernize physical infrastructure like bridges and roads.
But there will also be investments in an infrastructure for the future: broadband, research and development, public transportation, modernized schools, and a more expansive network of child-care providers.
 Perhaps most critically, the Jobs Plan invests in a clean and sustainable future, one in which America leads the way in a global economic transformation to a lower carbon economy. The plan invests public dollars in clean energy, electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, electricity grid improvements, and clean manufacturing. And importantly, these public dollars will unlock private ones. By indicating where our country is heading on climate investment, we will tap into the trillions of dollars of private capital that have already made sustainable investing one of the fastest growing investment sectors worldwide.
 Then there is the American Families Plan, which includes major investments in education, childcare, and the care economy. As I mentioned, investment in early childhood care can be an important determinant of labor force participation. But so can paid leave. Expanding these programs is a critical step in reversing the ongoing divergence in labor force participation rates in our country compared to other developed countries.
 In addition, a versatile education system that is closely tied to local labor markets should be a cornerstone of any 21st-century public investment program. Which is why our administration has committed to making community college free for every American.
 Alongside the Jobs Plan, we are proposing a fiscally responsible path to pay for our investments by fundamentally reforming the corporate tax system.
 With corporate taxes at a historical low of one percent of GDP, we believe the corporate sector can contribute to this effort by bearing its fair share: we propose simply to return the corporate income tax toward historical norms. At the same time, we want to eliminate incentives that reward corporations for moving operations overseas and shifting profits to low-tax countries. As part of this effort, we are working with our international partners on a global minimum corporate tax to stop the race to the bottom.

In addition to raising revenue, the Administration’s corporate tax proposals are focused on encouraging firms to invest in the United States, to create good-paying jobs for our nation’s workers. By eliminating tax preferences that encourage the offshoring of tangible assets and expanding credits for research and development and clean energy generation and storage, the reforms will encourage companies to invest, produce, and innovate on American soil.
 Our plans are ambitious, and the President and I believe now is the time to recommit our government to playing a more active and smarter role in the economy.
 The Administration’s planned actions are not fiscal stimulus in the way we have seen in the past. Nor are they intended to target a particular size of government. Rather, we’re proposing smart investments—to make our economy more competitive and sustainable.

370,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."

372,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
373,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

374,,"June 5, 2021","Thank you for joining us today.

I would like to thank Chancellor Sunak and Her Majesty’s government for hosting.

This was our first in-person multilateral meeting — and I can definitively say a real life G7 meeting is much more enjoyable than the Zoom version. More importantly, our meetings this weekend emphasize the power of global cooperation in addressing the most critical issues we face.

Our most immediate task is ending the pandemic and its associated economic crisis.

Fiscal policy has an important role to play in responding to crises and supporting the recovery. The IMF projects that the U.S. will be the first G7 economy to return to its pre-pandemic output level. That’s in part due to our rapid vaccine rollout, but also ambitious fiscal support in policies like the American Rescue Plan.

G7 economies have the fiscal space to speed up their recoveries to not only reach pre-COVID levels of GDP but also to support a return to pre-pandemic growth paths. This is why we continue to urge a to shift in our thinking from “let’s not withdraw support too early” to “what more can we do now.” Not just to end the pandemic, but to use fiscal policy to invest in addressing generational issues like climate change and inequality.

As the G7 economies face brighter prospects, we cannot forget that developing countries face limited access to vaccines and limited policy space to respond to the economic crisis. Our collective fear is that the pandemic leads to a lingering divergence where advanced economies rebound quickly, while developing countries lag and bear deep scars from the crisis for years to come.

The G7 discussed how to try to prevent that divergence, first, by helping developing countries vaccinate their populations. The surest way to do that is to keep supporting the COVAX Facility, which purchases and distributes doses to poorer countries. The Government of Japan hosted a successful pledging Summit for COVAX on June 2, and I thank the countries who stepped-up their contributions to this important effort. The U.S. remains committed to the success of COVAX and will continue to disburse our $4 billion pledge, the largest to the facility. The G7 also discussed how our existing tools, such as World Bank and IMF financing, can better help fund a global immunization effort and how we can enhance our coordination to prevent and better respond to future pandemics.

We also discussed ways to provide greater economic support to developing countries through the international financial institutions that would put developing countries on a path to a strong and sustainable green recovery. The G7 reiterated our support for a new allocation of IMF Special Drawing Rights to boost global reserves and provide additional liquidity as IMF members confront the crisis. We strongly support the IMF providing clear, tailored guidance to countries on how best to utilize their new SDRs, as well as proposals to increase transparency in and accountability for how SDRs are used. The G7 also exchanged ideas on how major economies might channel our SDRs to amplify support for low-income countries, potentially by co-financing IMF programs to support green recoveries and improve vaccine access.

G7 countries also redoubled our commitment to a transformative effort to tackle climate change. President Biden recently signed an Executive Order in April committing to double U.S. climate finance by 2024, while tripling U.S. finance for adaptation — signaling a return to U.S. leadership in addressing climate change. I am pleased the G7 could agree to ambitious commitments to decarbonize our economies and mobilize finance for climate action, including from public and private, domestic, and international sources. To facilitate the mobilization of private climate finance, the G7 also agreed to take action to improve the availability of consistent, comparable, and decision-useful climate-related financial information to market participants. This commitment is in line with the President’s Executive Order to enable private investment to play a complementary role in meeting our net-zero emissions target while also creating well-paying jobs. We look forward to advancing this work in the coming months with the broader G20, where Treasury is co-chairing the G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group.

Perhaps most notably this weekend, G7 economies came together to agree the post-pandemic world must be fairer, especially with regard to international taxation. We need to have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises and ensure that all citizens and corporations fairly share the burden of financing government. For too long, there has been a global race-to-the-bottom in corporate tax rates — where countries compete by lowering their tax rates instead of the well-being of their citizens and natural environments.

The G7 has taken significant steps this weekend to end the existing harmful dynamic, making commitments today that provide tremendous momentum towards achieving a robust global minimum tax at a rate of at least 15%. That global minimum tax would end the race-to-the-bottom in corporate taxation and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the U.S. and around the world.

The global minimum tax would also help the global economy thrive, by leveling the playing field for businesses and encouraging countries to compete on positive bases, such as educating and training our work forces and investing in research and development and infrastructure. And indeed the global minimum tax can help fund investments in those critical priorities.

Finally, by collaborating with one another on the global minimum tax, governments protect their national sovereignty to set tax policy, because the pressures that have forced the race to the bottom on corporate tax rates are alleviated.

This effort is far from over, and we look forward to engaging closely with the G20 and members of the OECD Inclusive Framework process in the coming weeks to finalize an agreement on the global minimum corporate tax as soon as possible.

At the same time, I look forward to taking the momentum we’ve achieved on a global reform at this G7 and working closely with members of Congress on this important initiative.

I look forward to taking your questions.

Q: You mentioned in your remarks that you continue to urge a shift in thinking away from “let's not withdraw support too early,” to “what more we can be doing now.” I just wanted to ask, do you think there is a risk that other G7 countries are withdrawing support too soon? Thank you.

SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, I think all of the G7 countries have had robust responses to the pandemic and supported their economies to achieve a strong recovery and all are actively involved in vaccination programs, but there is a concern among some about fiscal sustainability, and an evident desire to begin to withdraw accommodation when things are back on track. And we think that most countries have fiscal space, and have the ability to put in place, fiscal policies that will continue promoting recovery and deal with some of the long-run challenges that all of us face when it comes to climate change and inclusive and sustainable growth, and we urge countries to do that. And that's the course that we're on as well.

Q: Clearly, an agreement was reached on the global minimum taxation of at least 15 percent. Your country wanted 21 percent a few weeks back. What do you say to those campaigners who say 15 percent isn't really going to bite, isn't going to be the transformative change that they want to see and the world might need?

SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, what we've proposed, the 21 percent, is what we've proposed to do domestically. Our domestic corporate tax proposal that's part of the Jobs Plan is for a 28 percent corporate tax rate and a reform of our global minimum tax, to raise the level to 21 percent, and we haven't demanded or expressed the view that it's necessary for us to have the same level globally, but we do hope that countries will be ambitious, and the agreement is at least 15 percent. So, we've yet to set the final rate. There is an agreement among the G7, though, to go for at least 15 percent. And I do think that's an historic achievement. I think we will end up with a tax system that will be much fairer and end, effectively, much tax competition in the ability of large profitable multinationals to take advantage of tax havens to lower their corporate tax liabilities. And so, 21 percent is the minimum that we've proposed domestically.

Q: Your statements have made no mention of the digital services taxes and the Pillar One part of the agreement. I was wondering, why did you accept a deal that does not immediately remove the digital services taxes that the U.S. thinks are discriminatory, and if it takes two to four years to enact this agreement will the U.S. move ahead with the tariffs that are already teed up?

SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, let me say that both Pillars are important in the negotiation. I didn't mention Pillar One in my remarks, but it's not because Pillar One is not important. The allocation of global taxing rights over the profits, the residual profits of highly profitable large corporations, is something that's a concern in many parts of the world, and our agreement on that is also very important. We've agreed that we will award taxing rights on at least 20 percent of residual profit, that's above a 10 percent margin, for the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises, and the agreement is that that will replace the system that we've had concerns with. The timing remains to be worked out exactly, but there is broad agreement that these two things go hand in hand.

Q: I wanted to ask, the French wanted to target Amazon and Facebook. What impact does today's deal have on companies like those, and have you given your European counterparts any assurance that the final deal would necessarily include large tech firms?

SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, it will include large profitable firms, and those firms, I believe, will qualify by almost any definition. And essentially what we've agreed, is that we will reallocate taxing rights for a portion of the excess or residual profits of those companies to jurisdictions where they have market activity on the basis of the distribution of that activity. So, that is intended to replace an approach that focused on just a few U.S. digital giants, and the agreement is that this new approach will replace an approach that we found objectionable that targeted large, successful U.S. digital firms, but most of those firms are likely to be included in this new scheme, the Pillar One scheme.

Q: What do you expect will be the most, the toughest obstacle to overcome to reach the global agreement? Would it be, domestically, the U.S. states which have already lower tax rates or, internationally, countries like Ireland or China?

SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, we feel that we have strong momentum toward a global agreement that we will reach at the G20 meeting, a preliminary agreement in July with details to be finalized in the fall. And there are a number of countries that have concerns. Ireland and China are examples. This isn't a finished agreement. There are details still to be worked out. So what we've tried to emphasize in the G7 statement that we put out today, is that this group of countries are very supportive of two important pieces of what needs to be an agreement, namely an agreement among all these countries to tax, to have minimum corporate tax rates that apply to their companies on a country-by-country basis of at least 15 percent, and an agreement that we will reallocate taxing rights in Pillar One and apply it to the most profitable companies. So, there remain details yet to be worked out, and we will be addressing those in the run up to Venice.

Q: Can I please just ask you, what is your assessment of what the critical mass is for this agreement to work if you'd like? How many countries need to sign up for it to be workable? How many, what sort of share of world GDP if you prefer, needs to take part to make sure that there aren't going to be holes in this? Thank you.

SECRETARY YELLEN: So, we're looking for endorsement of an agreement at the G20, which represents a very large share of GDP. And there are yet a large, larger number of countries that are participating in the underlying OECD process that we expect, if we're successful with the G20, to agree. But I would point out that the agreement under Pillar Two contains an enforcement mechanism that would come into play and apply to jurisdictions that decide, “no we're happy to be tax havens, and we don't want to sign up to this agreement.” The so-called “under tax payment rule” would essentially put pressure on those countries to abide by a corporate minimum tax, or in essence supply it to income of companies that are headquartered there and currently booking profits in those countries. So, I think this is an agreement that when you understand all the details, you would see that it doesn't require absolute agreement across the board. It has a way of bringing holdouts into it.

Q: Just to return to Pillar One. Could you outline how you will be trying to persuade your Congressional legislators to put this through Congress and get support for it, which is necessary for this to have? What's the argument of why it’s in favor, why is it in the U.S. interest to have a Pillar One?

SECRETARY YELLEN: I think a Pillar One deal will really provide a level of certainty to corporations, in the United States and globally, about what the environment is that they'll be operating in. That environment has been very unstable and saying that they look forward to working with us to make the changes in our own law that are necessary to come into compliance with Pillar Two.

Q: Could you say something about multilateralism because, obviously you know, the experience of the past four years, I think, has made a lot of people feel that some of these multilateral institutions and the principle of multilateralism may have gone forever. So, in the light of this tax agreement, what's the lesson of that? Do you think that system can be revived or has it really changed?

SECRETARY YELLEN: I believe that what you're seeing is a revival of multilateralism, a willingness of leading nations in the G7 and the G20 to cooperate to address the most critical challenges facing the global economy. And this international tax race to the bottom has been a problem for many, many countries for decades, and it's led to a system in which corporate taxation plays a diminishing role in financing governments in the U.S. and around the world. And more and more of the burden has been falling on workers, and many countries have an interest in changing that dynamic. It's complicated. This negotiation has been going on for, I believe, eight years. It stalled under the Trump Administration.

And so, I really consider this an historic achievement, and it is. It shows that multilateral collaboration can be successful. But I think multilateralism is not confined simply to the tax area. And what I've seen during my time at this G7 is deep collaboration and a desire to coordinate and address a much broader range of global problems, in particular, the problems that some of the poorest countries on our planet face as a consequence of the pandemic. A broad understanding and desire on the part of the G7, and I believe the same exists in the G20 and other groupings, is that we need to address that. We need to address the health situation, that it's urgent that we promote vaccinations in poor countries that can't afford to buy those vaccines. Although we certainly agree with patent rights in general and we have supported in the WTO, in the case of vaccines, getting rid of patent rights with these vaccines, in the interest of doing everything that we can to deal with supply chain problems that are inhibiting a buildup of production capacity in other parts of the world.

And with respect to fiscal policy, the G7 countries recognize their obligation, not only to promote recovery in their own countries, for the sake of their own people and economies, but also the obligation that we have given the fiscal space we have to promote a strong recovery that will spill over to the rest of the world, for those countries who do not have the fiscal space.

We spent a good deal of time at the G7 discussing ways to make good on our pledge to provide finance for sustainable investments in developing countries and climate change initiatives, and we talked about debt relief in other ways. The SDR allocation, which we've all agreed to, I also think is a historic achievement in addressing global problems. So, on many different fronts, I think you're seeing a return of multilateralism, and a commitment on the part of countries that we need to have collaborative arrangements and to be active in and committed to addressing global challenges together.

Q: I guess some people would say seeing U.S. inflation where it is, seeing the serious sheer size of the public deficits, not just in your country but around Europe, you're now saying go even further. This is coming from the U.S. Treasury Secretary. We're used to the Washington consensus. This is very different America we're experiencing right now. Are you really saying that there are no risks from the old foes of inflation, and the like? That we should, we can be relaxed about those right now?

SECRETARY YELLEN: Well, we have in recent months seen some inflation. And we, at least on a year-over- year basis will continue, I believe through the rest of the year, to see higher inflation rates, maybe around 3 percent. But I personally believe that this represents transitory factors. And I will say that the, in the United States, there have been factors that are transitory that in past years have raised inflation without affecting the underlying inflation rate and factors that have lowered it that have also been transitory. And I genuinely believe that policy should look through transitory factors.

You know, when the pandemic struck, the prices in the most affected service sectors utterly plunged, and now we're in the months when those drops, pronounced drops which were lowering annual inflation rates, have now dropped out of year-over-year numbers. And we're moving into a phase where our economy is recovering and some of those prices are moving back up to normal. Airline fares would be a good example. They in April rose at a rapid rate. But that's just a return to normal. Airline fares are still below where they were pre-pandemic. Now while that process of return to normal is taking place, you will see some high inflation rates, but remember we saw some very low inflation rates. And so that's part of what's going on. We also have some supply bottlenecks that are affecting sectors of the economy. The semiconductor shortage is obviously affecting vehicle prices, used vehicle prices, and you know there are a variety of supply bottlenecks.

Look, we still have over 7 million fewer jobs right now than we had pre-pandemic. There have been retirements of some people from the labor force, probably induced by the pandemic, so maybe we don't need to regain quite that many to get back to full employment. But there remains a lot of slack in an underlying sense in the labor market.

Now, a lot of people have permanently lost jobs, and those individuals may want to move to different sectors of the economy. It may take a while to get the economy back completely on track and those individuals reabsorbed into long-term jobs. So, we shouldn't expect this process to be complete in a month or two, but I strongly believe we're on a recovery path. We're making progress. You know, if we continue at this pace I believe sometime next year we'll be back to something we could call around full employment. And while we're seeing some inflation, I don't believe it's permanent. But we will watch this very carefully. I don't want to say, “this is mind absolutely made up and closed.” We'll watch this very carefully, keep an eye on it and try to address issues that arise if it turns out to be necessary."
375,,"June 5, 2021","The G7 Finance Ministers have made a significant, unprecedented commitment today that provides tremendous momentum towards achieving a robust global minimum tax at a rate of at least 15%. That global minimum tax would end the race-to-the-bottom in corporate taxation, and ensure fairness for the middle class and working people in the U.S. and around the world.  The global minimum tax would also help the global economy thrive, by leveling the playing field for businesses and encouraging countries to compete on positive bases, such as educating and training our work forces and investing in research and development and infrastructure. "
376,,"May 20, 2021","Achieving net zero emissions in the United States will require transformational investments in our energy sector and the broader economy, and the global financial sector will be a crucial player, helping channel capital into investments that green our society.The Executive Order (EO) articulates a plan to make that happen; it coordinates regulatory efforts to assess climate-related financial risks and risks to financial stability.  As Chairperson of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), I am prioritizing this work.  At my first FSOC meeting as Chairperson in March, we discussed climate change and financial stability.  FSOC members were highly engaged and have already begun to analyze the issues within their jurisdictions.  FSOC can build on these efforts underway at individual regulators in several important ways.Financial regulators, financial institutions, and investors need to have access to the best information and data to measure climate-related financial risks.  FSOC will work with Council members to improve climate-related financial disclosures and other sources of data to better measure potential exposures. Regulators also face common challenges incorporating climate risks into their regulatory and supervisory activities.  Assessments of climate-related financial risks may require new perspectives and new tools.  FSOC will work with regulators to share perspectives, identify common impediments, and find solutions to those impediments.  A critical task is pulling together individual agency perspectives to assess how climate risks may impact the stability of the entire financial system. As directed in the EO, I will engage with FSOC on all these challenges to issue a report later this year, including reporting on any actions the Council recommends to mitigate risks to financial stability. The coordinated approach to financial stability I have outlined is what FSOC is designed to do—and will ensure the most effective approach to improving the resilience of the financial system.  This work will be challenging, and we cannot delay this hard work any longer.  I will also work to ensure that Treasury engage fully with our global partners through the G-7, G-20, and Financial Stability Board, helping to promote a strong and consistent global approach.Our pensions, our savings – our future livelihoods – depend on the financial sector to build a more sustainable and resilient economy. We all need to have the best tools and the best data to make well-informed decisions. This EO puts us on a path to get there."
377,,"April 22, 2021","President Biden, Secretary Kerry, and other distinguished guests, I am honored to join you at today. The global community has only a short time to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change:  We need a “sprinting start” now if we wish to achieve our goal of net-zero emissions by mid-century.  President Biden has recommitted the United States to do its part to tackle this crisis and marshal the full capacity of the U.S. government.As Treasury Secretary, I understand that finance—public and private—is crucial to enable countries to accelerate their progress toward a net-zero emissions future and cope with a climate that is already changing.  But this will require economic and political choices.  Government and business leaders around the world are pondering these choices, so let me mention two questions that keep me up at night.First, how can nations best reduce emissions, while supporting economic development and growth and responding to other major challenges, such as COVID-19?  This is especially challenging for low-income countries that have few available resources and pressing development needs.Second, how should governments target public sector climate finance to mobilize the greatest private sector investments?  Past efforts to support private investment have not achieved anywhere near the scale needed to green the global economy.I can tell you that the United States Treasury will focus the full range of our tools and expertise to work with you in producing concrete and innovative answers to these questions.Multilateral institutions are invaluable partners to the pursuit of sustainable, inclusive, and resilient development.  For these reasons, we have requested $1.25 billion for the Green Climate Fund to, in part, make good on our $2 billion outstanding pledge, $485 million to support other multilateral climate initiatives, and increased support for the multilateral development banks in our 2022 Budget. And, looking ahead, we will consider requesting funds for additional new contributions to the Green Climate Fund and other initiatives.As you will hear from our panel, while we are making progress, there is a need for redoubled efforts to boost the flow of capital and foster the growing market demand for climate-aligned investments.  This effort will involve engagement on many fronts.U.S. Treasury is working to facilitate investments in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect against the impacts of a changing environment.  We do that in part by providing technical assistance to foreign counterparts that helps attract private sector investment in clean energy and sustainable infrastructure projects.  We are also working with the G20 and co-chairing a sustainable finance working group that will establish a sustainable finance roadmap and improve the information that private investors need to make investment decisions aligned with a more healthy and prosperous future.In the end though, we know we will only achieve our goal of curtailing climate change through collective action. Today, we as a global community, need to be ambitious, set goals, work together, and sprint toward a cleaner, safer, better future.  We look forward to meeting this challenge together."
378,,"April 6, 2021","Thank you very much, Larry. It's a pleasure to be here with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and with U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to discuss the economic recovery in the kickoff of our Spring Meetings. The world faces major challenges, including COVID, climate change, rising poverty and inequality and growing fragility and violence in many countries. The inequality is most apparent in the direct effects of COVID that hits informal workers and the vulnerable the most. The inequality extends well beyond that to vaccinations, the concentration in wealth, the unequal impact of the fiscal stimulus and asset purchases, and the imbalance in debtor-creditor relationships, particularly for people in the poorest countries. The World Bank Group is leaning forward as much as possible to face these challenges. In response to COVID-19, we took broad, fast action and quickly achieved over 100 active operations of support for developing countries.Commitments rose 65% in 2020 from 2019. On vaccines, working closely with Gavi, WHO, and UNICEF, we've conducted over 100 capacity assessments, many even more before vaccines were available. We are now passing several specific country vaccine financing operations each week through our Board with already 10 approved, 10 more scheduled in April, and around 30 more expected in May and June for a total of around $4 billion in 50 countries. There are major challenges for the countries in securing deliveries, from COVAX and manufacturers, and we're working to support their efforts. Many developing countries entered the pandemic with unsustainable debt levels. We've worked to achieve a debt service suspension initiative and increased transparency in debt contracts. Both steps are helping. We've dramatically increased our grants and loans to the DSSI countries. Our goal is to maximize resources available to people, and we're working in close collaboration with the IMF, to support the G-20’s implementation of the common framework we're pushing forward together on Chad, and the World Bank hopes to be able to put in substantial fast-disbursing resources. Chad has a heavy burden of collateralized debt owed to a very narrow group of creditors presenting specific challenges.Finally, we're finalizing a new climate change action plan, which includes a big step up in financing, building on our record climate financing over the past two years. It includes new analytical support to countries as part of integrated climate and development programs. We want to achieve as much impact as possible with the increased financing. Our plan identifies key priorities for action, with a focus on both adaptation and mitigation. It also includes a strong focus on a just transition from coal, and we're working toward aligning our financial flows with the objectives of the Paris agreement.To conclude, I've noted big challenges. We're working to bring all together to achieve what we call GRID: green, resilient, and inclusive development. We'll have separate events on debt tomorrow, climate transitions on Thursday, and vaccines on Friday.And now, let me turn to Secretary Yellen, and I'm so pleased you're here. Thank you very much for that.  Dr. Yellen, it's been a year since we were on a presentation together. The world had a very hard year, and the United States under your leadership is having a big impact. Could you go through what the U.S. is doing to help the world recover economically from the crisis?Well, thanks so much, David. It's a pleasure to be with you. Well, first of all, domestically, we're focusing on the pandemic and trying to promote vaccinations, testing, contact tracing to get it under control, because we recognize that for the United States and for the world as a whole, the pandemic really is what's going to call the shots in terms of how the economy does. So that's first and foremost at home, and I think it's equally important for the entire globe. We are trying to support the most vulnerable people, who typically are low-income people and minorities in the United States. And the same is true globally, I think. Those who work in the service sector and minorities, vulnerable people, have been most impacted both healthwise and in terms of the economic impact. So, we have many programs that are supporting them.Unemployment insurance programs are relief, for rental assistance, homelessness, support for families that are burdened with women who are out of the workforce because children can't go to school, trying to reopen schools as promptly as we can and support state and local governments. We've decided to go big, because we think that the risks are of severe scarring if we allow there to be long-term unemployment and we're projecting a pretty rapid as the, we deal with the pandemic. We're expecting a rapid recovery. I'm hopeful, we'll be back to full employment next year. And once we are, we're going to turn to a longer-term agenda of investment: investment in infrastructure, in R&D, in people. But globally, I think that what we're doing domestically is helpful to the entire global community, stronger growth in the U.S. is going to spill over positively, to the entire global outlook. And we are going to be careful to learn the lessons of the financial crisis, which is, don't withdraw support too quickly. And we would encourage all those developed countries that have the capacity, using fiscal policy and monetary policy to continue to support a global recovery for the sake of the growth in the entire global economy.Thanks, fabulous. Kristalina, Managing Director Georgieva, you have been in the forefront of worry about the inequality in the system. And I wonder if you could give us some thoughts on that and what can the IMF do to ease the inequality.Thank you very much for having me here at the Bank. Fantastic to be with Secretary Yellen and with you.  and if I may say, David, I am so grateful that you are focusing on this question of inequality. What do we see today? The world economy is on a sounder footing. The recovery is progressing, and actually actions taken by the United States to boost prospects for recovery in the U.S. are helping the whole world. We are upgrading our projections for the year, but economic fortunes within countries and across countries are diverging dangerously.And this is why in these Meetings, we are focusing on giving everyone a fair shot. A fair shot in the arm everywhere so we can bring the pandemic to a durable end to underpin sustainable recovery. But also a fair shot to a chance for a better life for vulnerable people and for vulnerable countries. And it is so important for the reasons both of you outlined that, that it is a focus, because if we don't do it, then we risk inequalities to deepen and to hold societies and to hold growth back. What does it mean for us at the IMF? First and foremost, we have stepped up significantly the provision of financial lifelines to vulnerable countries, emerging markets with weak fundamentals, low-income countries are joining you, the World Bank in making sure that those with limited fiscal space, no access to markets, are not left out from the recovery.We have done dramatically more just to give you one number, 13 times more lending to low-income countries than we would do in an average year. And we are committed to continue to support them through the recovery. More importantly, we have included in virtually almost all our programs, quantitative targets for social spending to make sure that especially spending for education and health and social protection is in place. But also, that attention is being given to the empowerment of women. They're getting now the short end of the stick in this crisis, and that we target support to the most vulnerable parts of the economy and the most vulnerable people. Going forward and working with you, working with our shareholders, what we want to see is a comprehensive program of support you spoke about that. We cannot ignore that sustainability in this crisis, provision of more concessionary resources and also seeking ways in which we can boost reserves, especially for countries with no market access. So ultimately this fair shot would bring the worlds together because in this crisis, we have no way to get through without pulling together.Yeah, this is huge. A fair, shot. Dr. Yellen, Madam Secretary, you interact with the advanced economies a lot. What can everyone do working together to achieve an inclusive recovery? How do we make progress on those tough issues?Well, let me second a number of the points that Kristalina just made. I think it's the responsibility of the developed countries to make sure that decades of progress in fighting poverty globally and trying to close income gaps between rich and poor countries — we need to see that that progress is not reversed because of the pandemic. And I hope, as we gather together for the spring meetings, that's going to be our focus. We need to provide a package of resources that your organizations can use to help developing countries, low-income countries. I hope that we'll make progress on approving an SDR allocation, which I think would be a very important way to support the reserve needs globally, especially of low-income countries. You mentioned tackling debt. I think that's an extremely important initiative, concessional finance for the poorest countries.  You know, I hope that this will be the focus and the developed countries will band together to make sure that we provide that support.Yeah, absolutely. And I liked very much the way you said that as the U.S. expands, that has benefits for everyone. And we can extend that as Europe expands, that has benefits and the developing world, I think really welcomes that growth coming out of the advanced economies as it can be achieved. So, I was very happy to hear Kristalina say an upgrade in the IMF forecast for that. I want to turn a little bit if we may to climate change. These are immense issues for the whole world, and so each of us in our various ways are interacting. I went through our climate change action plan that we're, that we're just releasing, but I wonder for the IMF, how do you think about the climate change issues in the context of the macro economic challenges that you work on and how can the IMF help on this area?Climate risks are a growing threat to macroeconomic and to financial stability. And with the same token climate action offers the prospects for green growth in green jobs, critical for what we do at the IMF in supporting growth and employment. What we have embraced as a latecomer in this conversation is to zero in on our comparative strengths. What is it that we are uniquely positioned to help the world accelerate the transition to the new climate economy? And it is macroeconomic data and research, fiscal and monetary policies, crisis prevention, crisis response. So, what we are doing at the IMF, working very closely with the World Bank and other organizations, are four areas of stepping up our work. So, it is at the heart of what we do. First: policy advice, we engage with all countries in what is known as Article 4 consultations. And when we do so, we look at the criticality of mitigation and adaptation policies.Naturally, we do more on mitigation in countries that are high emitters. We do more on adaptation in countries that are more vulnerable. For example, countries like China, U.K., there we look primarily at carbon intensity, what can be done with good policies. When we go to the Caribbean, naturally, we focus on vulnerability and adaptation, or Sub-Saharan Africa for that matter. Secondly, we are zeroing in on climate-related financial stability risks, and we have a big role to play: standardized reporting of this risks, stress testing, and looking at the role of supervisory authorities. We have an instrument together with the World Bank, the financial sector assessments. We are integrating climate-related risks in these assessments. Third, data. Data tells a story to finance ministers like nothing else, integrating carbon intensity and other climate data in quarterly macroeconomic data is what we are pursuing, again working with other organizations. So, we are going to have a dashboard that would help policymakers to see in one place, their growth numbers, employment numbers, carbon intensity numbers. Last but not least, David capacity development. Countries need to speed up their ability to integrate climate policies in their macroeconomic policies. And we are there for them.Fabulous. Janet, President Biden has talked about the whole-of-economy approach. And you've noted that poor countries often are not the ones emitting the greenhouse gases, or not in such quantities. So, we have this challenge that Kristalina is talking about of the diagnostics being applied. So where are the areas that we can have most effect? So, I wonder your thoughts on how does the world better invest in this problem and solving it?So, obviously climate change is a global problem, and we're not going to really be able to deal with greenhouse gas emissions successfully unless countries like the United States act domestically and then foster the transfer of resources in the financing that’s necessary for developing countries to be able to do so successfully. President Biden is very focused on the U.S. climate agenda. He’s going to be proposing a package of infrastructure and climate change investments to make sure that we make our own domestic contribution to meeting the Paris objectives. And we look to you and working with you, in order to make sure that the necessary resources for green development and finance are transferred to the developing countries that really need those resources. And I think both of your organizations have very important roles to play, maybe distinct roles to play as Kristalina was mentioning, but, you know, we need to make sure that we help developing countries meet their climate goals along with their development objectives. And the availability of green finance is critical to that.This, you know, as we're putting out our climate change action plan, one of the key things we're trying to do right now this month is work with countries in DC, on their nationally determined contributions in their participation in the Paris agreement. And one of the challenges in that is how do you maximize the results for the country within their resources, within the world's resources. And that goes right back to the diagnostics area. What do have measurement on? How do we bring in adaptation for the poorest countries? It turns out the biggest thing that they need is the adaptation side this brings us all to, and let's both,  let's all discuss the importance of in the end, the private sector has to be fully engaged in this effort as well.  And so that involves the financial side, the financial intermediaries and the risks measurement of the risks that are in. And I think also just the big dollar investments that are needed in cleaner sources of energy. One of the things we're trying to do World Bank is on the electricity side, that more access for people, but in a way that's greener, and so that's a big challenge from a dollars and cents standpoint. Kristalina thoughts on private sector and investment flows?Well, the way we think about it at the Fund is that there has to be a framework that credibly directs private sector of a medium long-term. And the way that can be done is first to provide forward guidance on carbon price.  At the Fund, we concluded that, what is today $2 a ton is multiple times lower than where carbon price should be at least $75 a ton, but we can't go from here to here in one jump. So, giving that predictable forward guidance helps the private sector to then integrate reduction of carbon intensity in their own investment decisions. Secondly, there is a big role for the public sector to make it easier for the private sector to take the green turn. And it is green infrastructure push. I'm thrilled that United States is intending to pursue it. We calculated that over 15 years, a green investment push in a modest amount can generate 0.7% boost to growth, create many green jobs. But also what it does is it makes it possible for the private sector to find its way. Just imagine if we have electric charging stations easily accessible everywhere. The shift to green mobility is going to be much faster. And the third, and this is hugely important, private sector would step up when green finance is well underpinned exactly with what I was talking about. Reporting can crack, climate related financial stability, risks, creating conditions for boosting green bonds, because the private sector can see good accounting for impact. And this is where the bank is so fantastic by providing that ability to capture the meaning of greening. You said something very important David before and it is just transition. We are not going to win if there are losers unattended. If people in high carbon intensity sectors or regions do not get the helping hand, and we should not expect the private sector to solve this out entirely on its own. So again, it's very exciting to see that a country with so much clout internationally is taking on the leadership in that regard.That's fabulous.  We have the benefit here in the World Bank of having two eminent economists in fields, labor, and climate and environment, which is fabulous. And it puts together as we think about their just transition. A lot of countries have coal miners that are dependent on coal, and yet the world knows that  that, that there needs to be a way to a better future on that. And so, one of the things the World Bank can bring into that is in the nature of labor economics, incentives to help people move to new things. Are there others? What are your thoughts? How does the world make this transition and what are the investments? What are the labor force implications of this?So let me again echo my agreement with many of the points that Kristalina made. I think, to really make progress on climate we need both public investment and private investments and things like charging stations, and an electrical grid that's capable of handling renewable energy sources appropriately. These core investments are critical in order to provide the infrastructure, the public infrastructure to support private investments incentives. We're also looking at tax incentives to stimulate private R&D.  I think technological change will be important and we want to incentive in a green direction.  We see the potential for tax incentives for electric vehicles and the like, these are some ways in which we hope to stimulate private sector investments, and there will be opportunities. You know, we sometimes think this as something that's costly, but it's really important to emphasize that addressing climate change is going to bring opportunities to the private sector for investment and for our society.As a whole, you asked about labor markets, that's going to bring good jobs. And I believe that some work by the IMF shows that green investment tends to stimulate more jobs. It's more labor intensive than other forms of investment. So, there are opportunities here. And let me also echo my agreement about information. It's very important. There's a huge and growing interest in sustainable investing among financial institutions and investors around the world for that to be possible, they need information about companies and their exposure to climate risks. There's a global movement to try to provide consistent information that can be the basis for investment decisions. We're going to look carefully at that in the United States, to try to promote that. And of course, examination of risks, the type of scenario analysis, making sure that financial institutions understand the risks of climate change, due both to physical, environmental changes that will be caused by climate change, but also because of the potential for changes in asset prices or stranded assets. So those are some planks of the work we would like to see both domestically and globally.One of the interesting questions in this area are core economic questions, which are how do you incentivize? How do you price on some of the issues? How do you do that efficiently on a global basis when people have different policies? And so, I think, one of the things we're trying to do in our own work is to think about the core economic challenges. What's the most effective way to stretch the resources that are available to deal with the problems? One of the challenges has been, some chunk of greenhouse gas emissions comes from the agriculture sector. Yet agriculture is critical to food production and to labor. So how do we put all of those together? I know we're running toward the end of our conversation. Are there other topics that you want to raise? I'll turn to Kristalina.Well, the importance of us working together, we are in the Spring Meetings, it brings the world to concentrate on what we can achieve faster and more efficiently by working together. I want to say two things. One, we are not giving enough credit to collaboration that has already taken place. In this crisis Central Banks and finance authorities have stepped up swiftly in a coordinated manner. We just calculated that the IMF, that if that didn't happen on this scale, and in that degree of coordination, the recession would have been three times deeper. In other words, we would have been lingering into a depression. And that value of bringing everybody together cannot be overstated. And my second point is to take at least one cheer for our scientists that have delivered vaccines in a record short time. We owe it to them to make sure that everybody gets an access to vaccine. There is no more important economic policy today than doing exactly that. So, let's use our coming together for building up, the foundation of strong international cooperation for what you started from David: green, smart, inclusive future for all of us.Yeah, that's huge. Both the cooperation side and the technology side, and the careful use of technology to make the advances. And we could've spent the whole conversation on vaccines. I'm sure. Janet, closing?I would simply say, I think resilience is important. And to me, one of the lessons of the crisis is that the global system you know, should've learned that we need to be better prepared for crises than we were for this one.  This may not be our very last health crisis ever, and I hope we will learn that we need to work together to be better prepared for future crises. We've seen, certainly we in the United States have seen that our safety net wasn't all that it should be to protect the most vulnerable citizens.We have had to shore it up in a series of ad hoc actions. And I think making sure that our safety nets work here and throughout the world, for future crises. Global supply chains —we saw weaknesses and problems in global supply chains. I think we had very efficient supply chains, but not very resilient supply chains. And that's an area that I think we should be trying to shore up. And finally, I'd say we did a lot after the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 to shore up the resilience of our core banking system. And we should appreciate that we did not have a banking crisis. Our banking systems were able to support growth in credit. But some areas outside the core banking system of non-bank financial intermediation showed tremendous stress. So, I think we have more work to do to have a more resilient financial system. And in all these areas, again, globally, we need to work together to cooperate as in climate change to make progress.MALPASS That's a great conclusion. So let's leave it there with resilience and the preparation for being stronger on the recovery and in the next global expansion. Well fingers crossed. There's lots of work to be done, but that's a great conclusion. Thank you. Thanks to you both."
379,,"April 6, 2021","Let me begin by saying how excited the Biden-Harris Administration is to bring the United States back into the fold to tackle the generational issue of climate change.  Climate, by its very nature, requires strong global cooperation.  We lost four important years, and we recognize that many of you around the room have been leading change in your own countries.  The United States was pleased to join the Coalition last week, and my team and I look forward to engaging with you on this important agenda:  Finance ministries have a vital role to play, and there is much that we can learn from each other about how to integrate climate into our financial planning and decision-making. As one of his first acts upon taking office, President Biden signed an Executive Order for the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which we have now done, and announced an ambitious, whole-of-government approach to tackle the climate challenge.  Later this month, the President will host a Leaders’ Summit to galvanize efforts to keep within reach the important goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and to highlight the tremendous economic benefits of climate action.  The United States will also announce an ambitious 2030 emissions target in its new nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.The United States Treasury will play a critical role in this effort.  I would like to use my remarks to highlight some of the key activities that the Treasury is undertaking.       First, working through our leadership role in the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council and participation in international forums, we are working to understand and mitigate the risks that climate change poses to the stability of the financial system and macroeconomy in the United States and across jurisdictions.  This agenda includes working domestically and internationally to increase the availability of consistent, comparable, and reliable information on climate-related financial risks; to coordinate approaches among regulatory agencies to address climate risks; and to examine potential systemic consequences of climate change.  We are also supporting international efforts to better identify climate-aligned investments and encourage financial institutions to credibly align their portfolios and strategies with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.  Second, Treasury is actively working with the White House, Congress, and others to ensure that our domestic economic programs and tax policies support our climate goals, including a transition to a decarbonized economy, building climate-resilient infrastructure, and designing the climate transition to support equity and well-paying jobs.Third, we are working to increase the impact of our international climate finance tools.  We are seeking to increase the scale of climate finance and use these tools to leverage additional private investment.  At the multilateral development banks, we will support the alignment of their activities with the Paris Agreement and enhanced efforts to mobilize private finance for climate projects.Fourth, the reestablished G20 sustainable finance group is an important venue to tackle these issues and promote finance that supports our international climate and other sustainability goals.  We are pleased to be co-chairing the group."
380,,"March 31, 2021","Almost exactly one year ago, the pandemic’s outbreak caused significant stress in the economy and in the financial system. In response to the deep uncertainty, investors sought safety in the form of cash and short-term government securities. Bond markets became illiquid.If not for the swift actions of the Federal Reserve, Treasury, Congress, and others, those stresses may have led to an even greater economic contraction.Indeed, we are digging out of a deep hole now, but we should be mindful that the hole could easily have been even deeper. Increased capital and liquidity requirements imposed after the 2008 financial crisis helped banks weather the pandemic-induced crisis. But the fact that extreme policy interventions were still required to support market functioning should serve as a clear reminder: We have to do more to address vulnerabilities in the financial system.Last March, we saw evidence of how these vulnerabilities in nonbank financial intermediation can take the existing stress in the financial system and amplify it.It is encouraging that regulators are considering substantive reform options for money market mutual funds, and I support the SEC’s efforts to strengthen short-term funding markets.We also know open-end mutual funds offer investments with greater liquidity than their underlying assets. While these investment funds play a critical role in financing the economy, I believe this particular practice should also be reviewed.In fact, the SEC has been studying the performance of open-end mutual funds during the March 2020 market turmoil, and this afternoon the staff briefed us on their initial analysis.As a next step, I have asked for an interagency assessment to determine if additional measures should be taken to address this financial stability vulnerability, and, if so, to develop recommendations for the Council.The Council was also briefed by the Office of Financial Research regarding the performance of hedge funds through the COVID-19 crisis this afternoon. The pandemic showed that leverage of some hedge funds can amplify stresses, too.This Council used to have a Hedge Fund Working Group, and as of today, we have one again. We are re-establishing the working group so that we can better share data, identify risks, and work to strengthen our financial system.A deep and liquid Treasury market is essential for a strong U.S. economy. It is critical to the entire financial system. It supports the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency and is the benchmark for asset classes globally.We have to better understand the factors that contributed to an increase in the demand for liquidity by all types of investors – and a reduction in the supply of liquidity by dealers and principal trading firms. We also must strengthen the Treasury market itself and make it more resilient to future disruptions.Third, we cannot only look back and learn the lessons of last year. We must also look ahead, at emerging risks. Climate change is obviously the big one.It is an existential threat to our environment, and it poses a tremendous risk to our country’s financial stability. We know that storms will hit us with more frequency, and more intensity. We know warming temperatures might disrupt food and water supplies, leading to unrest around the world. Our financial system must be prepared for the market and credit risks of these climate-related events. But it must also be prepared for the best-possible case scenario: that we begin a rapid transition to a net-zero carbon economy, which also creates potential challenges for financial institutions and markets. On all these fronts, the Council has an important role to play, helping to coordinate regulators’ collective efforts to improve the measurement and management of climate-related risks in the financial system.The three areas that I highlighted—vulnerabilities in nonbank financial intermediation, the resiliency of the Treasury market, and climate change—are major challenges that will require our collective efforts. But these are not the only challenges to financial stability we face today. We must continue to identify and address other vulnerabilities, such as cybersecurity risks, the growth of nonfinancial corporate credit, the importance of large banks and central counterparties in our financial system, the evolving role of digital assets, and many others. I look forward to engaging on all these issues with the Council going forward.Let me close on a personal note: This is my first meeting as Chair, but as you all know, it is not my first meeting of this Council. I was a member for four years, and I have always viewed being a part of this body as some of the most important work I have ever done. Our task is to guard the nation’s financial system."
381,,"March 31, 2021","I began the month by discussing women in the economics profession.  I wanted to end the month, though, by looking at the bigger picture, with some thoughts about the recent economic history of women in America.When I came to Washington in the early ‘90s and re-joined the Fed, there was a revolution happening in the economic data. American women were finally taking their place in the workforce – and in big numbers.In between when I had left college – 1968 – and when I came to Washington, 31 million women had joined the labor force (compared to 22 million men). A higher percentage of American women worked than our counterparts in almost any other developed nation. Out of the 22 wealthiest countries, we ranked 6th in labor force participation. Of course, the picture was far from perfect. Women were paid less for the same work. (They still are.) And underneath the numbers, there was a widespread and intolerable culture of workplace discrimination, particularly for women of color. Still, no one could deny: My generation of women was economically better off than my mother’s. Progress was on the march. Until it wasn’t.Something started to happen around the turn of the millennium. Smaller and smaller cohorts of American women started joining the labor force – and more left it altogether. By 2010, American women no longer ranked 6th of 22. We were 17th.In fact, if you somehow transported economists from the 1980s to 2021 – and just showed them the labor force data – they would be hard-pressed to see that anything had changed. Even before 2020, the percentage of working women was near its 40-year low, and then, COVID-19 dropped it to its nadir.In some ways, there is such a frustrating irony at work in our labor markets. The country has certainly awoken to the reality that sexual harassment and discrimination are enormous problems. In this respect, the #MeToo movement was a pivotal moment for women already in the workplace. And yet, we seem to have a harder time getting and keeping women there.One obvious reason is childcare. A study looked at how much each wealthy nation spends on social programs like paid-family leave and subsidized childcare. The United States was near the bottom of the list, but the study found if we had been in the middle – and spent just the average world amount on those programs – American women wouldn’t be 17th in labor force participation anymore. We’d be 11th. Still not great, but better.The pandemic has turned the childcare problem into a crisis for mothers. We know that, unlike the fathers who left the workforce early last year, most of the moms haven’t come back yet. Will they return? I hope so. But if that happens it probably won’t be because we sat idly by; it will be, instead, because we used the powerful tools at the federal government’s disposal.This month, The American Rescue Plan began that work through a big expansion of the child tax credit and the most significant direct investment in childcare since World War II -- $25 billion – which will go directly to daycare centers and other providers. The pandemic has really hurt these businesses, and we want them to be there on the other side of the pandemic when Americans go back to work."
382,,"March 30, 2021","I’ve been an economist for a long time, and one area where I’ve focused my attention is on the disparity in economic outcomes – especially when it comes to race and ethnicity. It’s probably because I began studying the subject during the Civil Rights Movement. I took my first economics course around 1963. I was a freshman in college. Since then, our country has endured at least five major economic crises. There was the oil crisis and stagflation in the ‘70s, the double-dip recession of the early ‘80s, the burst of the dot-com bubble, and, of course, the Great Recession beginning in ’08. 
Each of these crises was very different, but they all shared at least one significant characteristic: They all hit Latino-Americans disproportionately hard.  In fact, if you take the Hispanic unemployment rate over the past 50 years and superimpose it on top of the national average, what you see are two lines that roughly move in tandem – except the Hispanic unemployment rate is always above the national average. And when there is a crisis, both rates spike, but the Hispanic rate spikes much higher.Economic crises generally do this: They take pre-existing inequalities – and make them even more unequal. To me, it’s one of the most pernicious effects of a struggling economy, and it’s something the President and I wanted to prevent from happening again. If someone tried to design an economic crisis that would unduly target the Hispanic community, they’d probably come up with something that looks a lot like COVID-19.  The five sectors[1]  the pandemic was most likely to slow or shut down accounted for 50 percent of revenues for Latino-owned businesses. They accounted for 65 percent of all Latino employment.[2] As this organization knows far better than I do, there was immense pain, and it cascaded down into higher rates of joblessness; into more Hispanic families late on their mortgages and their rent; into hunger: One-in-five Latino households still say they don’t have enough food to eat.[3] When I took office, I looked at economic data like these, and I worried that many of these families would be haunted by the COVID economy long after the health emergency was over. We know that when the foundations of someone’s life collapse – when they lose a small business or the ability to eat dinner every night – it can weigh them down permanently; their ability to earn is forever lowered. It’s a phenomenon called “economic scarring,” and I worried this would happen on a mass scale. 
 
That’s why the President and I had been so insistent that we deliver more relief… and now we are.  On March 11, the President signed the American Rescue Plan into law. It’s easily the most ambitious relief package since the Great Depression, and it includes a slate of programs that will help people make it to the other side of this pandemic. There’s funding to immunize people, to help people with their rent and mortgages, and to send $1,400-dollar checks to most families in the country.  There are a lot of very tired Treasury employees who’ve spent much of the last 19 days (and nights) figuring out how to get this money out the door – and doing so in a way that prioritizes the people who need it the most. We’ve been very focused on that – and not just for programs in this rescue plan, but for all the pandemic relief programs that existed previously. The Paycheck Protection Program is probably the one you’re most familiar with. PPP was supposed to be an early lifeline, but because of issues with the program’s design, the first rounds often didn’t reach the smallest businesses, which are disproportionately Hispanic-owned.[4] We’re addressing that now and  tweaking how we implement the program. It’s allowing us to reach millions more microbusinesses and entrepreneurs especially in rural and low-income areas. With the passage of the rescue plan, we will thankfully avoid economic scarring on a mass scale. At the end of the day, it will probably still be true that the pandemic economy followed the historic trend – and hit the Hispanic community harder than many other groups. But when we look back at the data, I don’t believe the effects will be as long-lasting as they would’ve otherwise. I think people will be ready to bounce back.  In fact, I expect we’ll be back at full employment by next year, and if history is any guide, Hispanic-owned businesses will drive a large portion of the recovery. From 2007 to 2012 – years that roughly track the Great Recession and the immediate rebound – the number of Latino-owned businesses grew by 3.3%. It doesn’t sound like much until you see that, during the same period, Non-Latino owned businesses declined by 3.6%.[5] And after 2012, the number of new Latino-owned business grew at more than twice the national average.[6] I want you to know: I am confident Hispanic entrepreneurs can lead us out of a crisis again. I know Hispanic workers can power our recovery – potentially in an even bigger way than a decade ago – so long as we remove some of the longstanding barriers that have been in your way. When it comes to the Hispanic community, there is such a frustrating irony in the historic data: On the one hand, this community outperforms in the creation of new businesses. On the other, you have less access to capital to create and grow them in the first place. One study looked at national banks and their loan approval rates for white- and Latino-owned firms. The approval rate for Latino-owned companies was 60% lower – and that’s even when controlling for how the business was performing.[7]    We know that Latinos – and especially Latinas – are overrepresented in the ranks of essential workers, the people who have kept our country afloat this past year. But we also know that support has not been returned in kind. Before the pandemic, Latinas accounted for 17 percent of the women in the labor force. Since the pandemic began, they’ve accounted for 27 percent of women who’ve left it. I believe a major cause is the burden of childcare. We have begun to do some of this. The American Rescue Plan, for example, includes funding so essential workers can pay for childcare. And at Treasury, we’re gearing up to inject $12 billion dollars into Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions. It’s more money than has flowed through these programs since their creation in the ‘90s, and I think it will make a meaningful difference in the ability Latino-owned firms to access capital. But this is just a start, and I need your help. I think this speech probably demonstrated that we have access to some very detailed economic data at Treasury, but there’s no replacement for the deep, personal knowledge you have. You know what it feels like to open shop and scale up in you communities. We need to understand that, too.  Good policymaking requires that we understand the humanity beneath the data, and I’m hoping you can help us there. I’ve been holding virtual roundtables with all sorts of business-related groups since taking office. It’s something my team and I are going to continue to do. Please come.  Tell us your challenges; tell us where we can do better; how we can clarify guidance or provide technical assistance. If work together, then I am confident that when someone looks back at the economic data around the pandemic, they won’t simply conclude that Hispanic workers and businesses were the victims of the 2020 economy. They’ll see that they were builders of a better one in 2021 and beyond. "
383,,"March 17, 2021","I know Indian country has suffered a disproportionate share of hardship in this country. But the pandemic has made that hardship harder. It’s thrown a bright spotlight on the disparities Tribal communities face.There have also been enormous financial losses. The Minneapolis Fed reports over 30 percent of Tribal enterprises had to lay off or furlough 80 to 100 percent of their workforce due to COVID.And regulatory and structural barriers Indian Country faced in accessing CARES funding meant that –for many– the relief your communities needed was delayed.I want you to know: We are working on addressing all this; our concern right now is ending the immediate public health threat of COVID-19 and the adjacent economic crisis.We want to work with you to get that funding out as quickly as possible – in the way that generates the biggest impact. That’s our first task together.But after the immediate crisis is over, this Administration wants to focus on the longer-term economic problems Indian Country has been enduring for years. We know, for instance, that in 2018, over a quarter of Native Americans lived below the federal poverty line, the highest rate among all minority groups in the United States.Once we get through COVID, we have to start asking: How can we ensure that people have well-paying jobs that lift and help to keep their families out of poverty?Many of you have likely seen President Biden’s Memorandum on Tribal consultation that outlined this Administration’s commitment to working with and listening to Tribal leaders.I know the TTAC has played a critical role, helping our Department address tax issues important to Indian country. I know the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014 has been a particular point of discussion.I really hope you’ll continue to play this role while I’m in office; I’d very much like to work with you – and make sure that tax policy doesn’t get in the way of economic development in Indian country.I also know there are really important issues for Indian Country beyond TTAC’s portfolio. Many things are tax issues, but not all of them are! And I want to engage on those as well."
384,,"November 27, 2023","WASHINGTON – From November 26 – December 1, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian E. Nelson will travel to Muscat, Oman as well as Ankara and Istanbul, Türkiye, to further U.S. efforts to deny Hamas and other terrorist organizations the ability to raise and move funds. He will also discuss the facilitation of legitimate humanitarian aid on an ongoing basis to the people of Gaza. Since the October 7th attacks, Treasury has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) financial facilitators and their affiliated entities.In Türkiye, a NATO ally, Under Secretary Nelson will also discuss efforts to prevent, disrupt, and investigate trade and financial activity that benefit the Russian effort in its war against Ukraine."
385,,"November 22, 2023","WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection (OCCIP) today released an advisory highlighting tips consumers can take to avoid becoming the victim of cyber or online scams this holiday shopping season. This year the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has enabled cybercriminals to automate malicious phishing attacks. As cybercriminals leverage AI to learn and adapt in real-time, consumers must remain vigilant and take proactive measures, especially during the holidays which often brings an uptick in crimes. To avoid becoming a victim of fraud, the advisory provides steps individuals can take to protect themselves. “Every year cybercriminals are getting more creative to take advantage of consumers, and this year is no different with the rise of AI,” said Deputy Assistant Secretary for OCCIP Todd Conklin. “If an online deal looks too good to be true, it likely is. Take time to think, research, and talk to someone you trust. Don’t be pressured to purchase an item or pay for a service quickly. Legitimate businesses and people will give you time to decide.” In the advisory, OCCIP details several tips consumers should follow to avoid being scammed. The advisory also provides steps victims of fraud can take to attempt to mitigate their damages and losses.A copy of the OCCIP advisory can be found here. Additionally, fraud may be reported to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). "
386,,"November 21, 2023","WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of the Treasury, through the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and IRS Criminal Investigation (CI), has taken unprecedented action to hold Binance Holdings Ltd. and its affiliates (collectively, Binance) accountable for violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions laws that protect American national security and the integrity of the international financial system. Binance is the world’s largest virtual currency exchange, responsible for an estimated 60% of centralized virtual currency spot trading. Today, Binance settled with FinCEN and OFAC for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and apparent violations of multiple sanctions programs. The violations include failure to implement programs to prevent and report suspicious transactions with terrorists — including Hamas’ Al-Qassam Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Al Qaeda, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) — ransomware attackers, money launderers, and other criminals, as well as matching trades between U.S. users and those in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea region of Ukraine. By failing to comply with AML and sanctions obligations, Binance enabled a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform. Today’s settlements are part of a global agreement simultaneous with Binance’s resolution of related matters with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).“Binance turned a blind eye to its legal obligations in the pursuit of profit. Its willful failures allowed money to flow to terrorists, cybercriminals, and child abusers through its platform,” said Secretary of the Treasury Janet L. Yellen. “Today’s historic penalties and monitorship to ensure compliance with U.S. law and regulations mark a milestone for the virtual currency industry. Any institution, wherever located, that wants to reap the benefits of the U.S. financial system must also play by the rules that keep us all safe from terrorists, foreign adversaries, and crime, or face the consequences.”FinCEN’s settlement agreement assesses a civil money penalty of $3.4 billion, imposes a five-year monitorship, and requires significant compliance undertakings, including to ensure Binance’s complete exit from the United States. OFAC’s settlement agreement assesses a penalty of $968 million and requires Binance to abide by a series of robust sanctions compliance obligations, including full cooperation with the monitorship overseen by FinCEN. To ensure that Binance fulfils the terms of its settlement — including that it does not offer services to U.S. persons — and to ensure that illicit activity is addressed, Treasury will retain access to books, records, and systems of Binance for a period of five years through a monitor. Failure to live up to these obligations could expose Binance to substantial additional penalties, including a $150 million suspended penalty, which would be collected by FinCEN if Binance fails to comply with the terms of the required compliance undertakings and monitorship. The monitor will oversee remedial undertakings necessary to address Binance’s failure to comply with its anti-money laundering and sanctions obligations. The monitor will also conduct periodic reviews and report to FinCEN, OFAC, and the CFTC on its findings and recommendations to ensure Binance’s ongoing compliance with the terms of the settlement agreements.  Today’s unprecedented actions underscore Treasury’s commitment to promoting compliance within the virtual currency industry, including by actively enforcing AML and sanctions laws. Treasury’s authorities to enforce those laws are broad, reaching a wide range of misconduct, and can apply to both U.S. and foreign persons. Wherever located, virtual currency exchanges and financial technology firms should, like any other financial institution, ensure they adopt a managerial commitment to compliance at the very top, and that risk-based programs and controls are integrated effectively into their platforms and technology from “Day One.” Treasury worked closely with counterparts at DOJ, including the Criminal Division's Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence & Export Control Section, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington, as well as the CFTC. Binance admits that it willfully operated as an unregistered money services business (MSB) while obscuring its ties to the U.S. and maintaining its most commercially important U.S. customers. Binance admits that it willfully failed to establish, implement, and maintain an effective anti-money laundering program by, among other things, failing to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) on a large number of its users. This meant that Binance allowed a range of illicit actors to transact freely on the platform, damaging the integrity of the financial system. FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance also failed to mitigate the risks of anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies that allowed its users to obscure information about the origin and destination of transactions. As an MSB, Binance was required to report suspicious transactions to FinCEN through suspicious activity reports (SARs). FinCEN’s investigation revealed that Binance’s former Chief Compliance Officer told personnel that the CEO’s policy was to not report such activity, and Binance never filed a single SAR with FinCEN. Binance willfully failed to report well over 100,000 suspicious transactions that it processed as a result of its deficient controls, including transactions involving terrorist organizations, ransomware, child sexual exploitation material, frauds, and scams. The historic sum of OFAC’s action reflects the egregious nature of Binance’s conduct, the high volume of its transactions, and senior management’s involvement. Between August 2017 and October 2022, Binance executed more than 1.67 million virtual currency trades on its Binance.com platform between U.S. persons and users in sanctioned jurisdictions and blocked persons. As early as mid-2018, Binance knew or should have known that enabling such activity would result in violations of sanctions. Nevertheless, Binance deliberately undermined and ineffectually implemented its own sanctions compliance controls. One way that Binance did so was through its suggestion that users utilize virtual private networks that could circumvent Binance’s own geofencing controls, i.e., technical protocols that blocked access for users with internet protocol addresses from the United States and sanctioned jurisdictions. In doing so, Binance sought to retain its base of U.S. users and the large volume of trading liquidity that U.S. users provided, while also keeping its customers from sanctioned jurisdictions. Binance knew that given the operation of its matching algorithm, maintaining both sets of users would inevitably lead to executed trades between U.S. and sanctioned jurisdiction users, violating sanctions in the process. To maintain this activity, Binance executives, including its CEO, issued guidance to “appear” compliant, while knowingly allowing the apparently violative activity to continue.Binance’s settlement is the largest in OFAC history, and Binance could face exposure up to billions of dollars in further penalties if it materially breaches its compliance commitments as described under the agreement. CI special agents led the criminal investigation into Binance and its founder that served as the basis for criminal charges and civil penalties. Evidence gathered as part of the investigation proved the company and its founder did not have an effective anti-money laundering program in place, the company did not register as a money transmitter as required by federal law, and the company willfully violated U.S. sanctions tied to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. CI is the criminal investigative arm of the IRS. For more than 100 years, CI special agents have spent 100% of their time investigating tax and financial crimes, a skillset that has easily transferred to the digital realm where they now follow the money trails of increasingly complicated cybercrimes. The agency has two Cyber Crimes Units — a Western Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Los Angeles Field Office and an Eastern Cyber Crimes Unit based in the Washington, D.C. Field Office — that conduct cyber investigations. The Western Cyber Crimes Unit, as well as CI’s headquarters-based Cyber and Forensic Services Section, played an integral role in the civil penalties announced Tuesday."
387,,"November 21, 2023",
388,,"November 17, 2023","Good afternoon. My name is Graham Steele, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury Department.  It’s my pleasure to help conclude this Treasury FIO-NYU conference on catastrophic risk and a potential federal insurance response. A number of people are responsible for making today’s event a success. Many thanks to our co-sponsor and generous host, NYU Stern’s Volatility and Risk Institute, co-directed by my friend Dick Berner, and to VRI’s Assistant Director Matt Hemphill.  Thanks also to my executive branch colleagues from the Office of the National Cyber Director and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for joining us today. Thanks to our experienced and knowledgeable panelists, representing so many insurance industry stakeholder organizations, for sharing their very useful insights. Thanks to my Treasury colleague FIO Director Steven Seitz and the Federal Insurance Office team for organizing this conference and spearheading Treasury’s work on this issue.  And considering the range of important roles that many of you in this room have in the cyber insurance ecosystem, thanks to all of you for coming this morning. I hope you’ve found the discussions useful. The Treasury team looks forward to continuing to work with you on these issues.  As the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions, I oversee a broad policy portfolio, encompassing banks, credit unions, and the insurance sector, as well as cybersecurity and critical infrastructure, community development, and consumer protection. The topic of today’s conference sits at the intersection of insurance and cybersecurity and critical infrastructure. Let me begin by discussing the relevant work done by those two offices, before diving deeper into the topic of the conference, catastrophic cyber insurance specifically, and concluding with a few points about our plans going forward.Cyber-related risk is a top priority for Treasury and the Biden administration.  As you heard this morning from Director Seitz, for over a decade the Federal Insurance Office has followed the evolution of the insurance sector’s important role in our increasingly digitally interconnected world.  Treasury and FIO have been working closely with our partners across the administration and are focusing on the following cyber insurance-related topics:First: cyber resilience.  FIO has worked with colleagues within Treasury and the administration on improving insurers’ own cyber resilience.  We have also cooperated with other federal and state partners and with international colleagues through multilateral groups such as the G-7.Second: we are focused on cyber insurance in lines of insurance eligible for coverage under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, or “TRIP.”   A cyber attack could be certified by Treasury as an “act of terrorism” as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, provided it otherwise meets the requirements of TRIP.  In recent years FIO has increased its collection of data on cyber insurance in order to improve Treasury’s evaluation of cyber insurance within the scope of TRIP, as well as improving our understanding of the overall cyber market. Third: FIO is prioritizing its work in The International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or “IFTRIP.”  IFTRIP is the umbrella organization for over 15 international terrorism risk insurance pools and mechanisms that engage in the insurance or reinsurance of terrorism risk.  FIO serves as the Vice Chair of IFTRIP and next April Treasury will be hosting the 2024 IFTRIP Annual Conference in Washington, DC as part of our work to assume more leadership of this group going forward.  At the Annual Conference, we expect that industry representatives and public sector authorities will discuss issues presented by terrorism risk in particular, as well as catastrophic risk more generally.  Our decision to take on more of a leadership role in the group demonstrates our commitment to working with our international partners on cyber issues.  We’re excited about the direction of IFTRIP’s future work under greater U.S. leadership, and we look forward to increasing our collaboration with the sector in this area.Fourth: Treasury and FIO continue to monitor and collect data on cyber insurance market developments.  We have long recognized that cyber insurance is a dynamic and growing market.  FIO’s 2023 Annual Report, published in September, observed a 50 percent increase between 2021 and 2022 in direct premiums for cyber insurance, growing from approximately $4.8 billion in direct premiums for both package and stand-alone policies in 2021, to approximately $7.2 billion in direct premiums last year.  However, this premium growth is not proportional to the growth in coverage.   Cyber insurers wrote nearly 4 million policies in 2022, which is only a 10 percent increase from 2021.  Importantly, there is substantial room for further growth.  2022 cyber premiums remained under one percent of the total P&C market, despite the consistent movement toward the digital transformation of everything we do in the physical world – a trend intensified at the peak of the pandemic, and which has not since reversed.  Additionally, the broker Marsh, whose CEO you heard from today, recently estimated that 36 percent of its insurance clients buy cyber insurance, and that the largest companies – those with greater than $1 billion in annual revenues – are far more likely to buy cyber coverage than small and medium-sized enterprises.I’d like to take a brief step back to discuss the broader cyber threat landscape.  Treasury’s Office of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection’s, or “OCCIP,” mission is to improve the security and resilience of the financial services sector through Treasury’s unique role in the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, or “FBIIC,” and the G7, both as a cabinet-level Department, and as Sector Risk Management Agency, or “SRMA,” for the financial services sector.  OCCIP serves as the central node for information related to all-hazard threats and seeks to build and maintain resilience through exercises sharing relevant threat information.  Additionally, OCCIP serves as a central hub and coordinating body for financial institutions and regulatory agencies that respond to cyber incidents when they do occur.  Finally, OCCIP advances U.S. Government policies and conducts whole-of-nation coordination for cybersecurity and infrastructure protection based on findings from the activities I’ve just described.In its SRMA capacity, OCCIP has been on the forefront of some of the most important issues of the day, including Treasury’s landmark Financial Services Sector’s Adoption of Cloud Services report and the upcoming work that we are undertaking on the implications of artificial intelligence, or “AI,” on financial services sector cybersecurity. The increasing adoption of cloud services and AI will only raise the stakes for public and private sector efforts to ensure operational and cyber resilience. Combating the growth of ransomware, and thereby decreasing policyholder ransom payments, remains a policy priority for Treasury and the Administration.  Industry sources report that after a possible decrease in successful attacks in 2022, there has been a substantial resurgence in ransomware attacks in 2023.  In a notable recent example, just last week, the US broker-dealer affiliate of the bank ICBC suffered a ransomware attack that has impacted its client clearing business.  This is not the first time this year that ransomware has disrupted financial sector operations.  In February and March, a ransomware attack on the trading firm Ion similarly disrupted its cleared derivatives business for several days.  Criminal actors with financial motives are not the only threat requiring the maintenance of up-to-date cyber controls, as we have seen in the multiple global crises playing out in the news.  Both the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel/Hamas conflict have included state and non-state threat actors employing cyber tactics with increased proficiency.  In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors conducted a wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian infrastructure, including several attacks targeting financial services sector entities. By April 2023, there was a significant drop in these incidents and a lull in state-sponsored activity has continued.  Additionally, Russia has been observed to coordinate destructive and disruptive cyberattacks aimed at Ukraine, network penetration and espionage in targeted countries that are perceived as Ukraine’s allies, and cyber-influence operations designed to influence people globally.  The Computer Emergency Response Team of Ukraine (CERT-UA) recorded nearly 4,000 cyber incidents between January 2022 and September 2023.  This represents a three-fold increase in cyber activity to the pre-war period.Cyber activity in the context of the Russia/Ukraine conflict is not limited to government actors.  We have observed that non-state cyber actors on both sides of the conflict have targeted a wide range of organizations – including in the financial services sector – with relatively unsophisticated incidents known as distributed denial of service attacks (DDOS).  In June 2023, pro-Russia hacktivist group NoName057(16) threatened to target Ukraine’s financial sector. In the following four days, numerous Ukrainian banks were targeted with DDoS attacks. Targets included four of the nation's largest commercial banks, including First Ukrainian International Bank (PUMB), State Savings Bank of Ukraine (Oshchadbank), Credit Agricole Bank, and Universal Bank.Shifting to Israel, since the onset of the conflict, there has been a significant increase in hacktivist groups targeting both Israeli and Palestinian entities.  The tactics, techniques, and procedures include low-level DDoS attacks, website defacements, data breaches, exploitation of known common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE), and a newly identified destructive wiper malware called Bibi-Linux (being used to destroy data in attacks targeting Linux systems belonging to Israeli companies), which has had minimal disruptive impact. According to Cloudflare, hacktivist groups have primarily targeted newspaper and media outlets with DDoS attacks, which have accounted for 56% of all attacks against Israeli websites. The second most targeted industry was the computer software industry, accounting for 34% of all DDoS attacks. The third most targeted was the Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance sector; followed by Government Administration websites.  Additionally, Indian cyber intelligence company FalconFeeds has identified 90 pro-Palestinian hacktivist groups. The most prominent pro-Palestinian hacker groups are KillNet, Anonymous Sudan, and Mysterious Team Bangladesh.Closer to home, Google, Amazon, and Cloudflare reported in October that they had withstood the internet’s largest-known DDoS attack, exploiting a new vulnerability known as “Rapid Reset”, with Google Cloud (from which you heard on the last panel today) reporting that its cloud service had dealt with an attack more than seven times larger than the previous largest attack.  In response, our colleagues at CISA swiftly issued an advisory notice warning about the vulnerability and recommending that organizations that deliver essential internet services quickly apply patches to their networks and implement other mitigation measures.The insurance sector has an important role to play in strengthening policyholder cyber controls in order to improve resiliency against attritional cyber incidents, including ransomware attacks.  By requiring robust cybersecurity practices to qualify for coverage, cyber insurers can, and have, incentivized best practices that defend against ransomware attacks and avoid the need for policyholder ransom payments.With all of that context, let me return to the main subject of my remarks, and today’s conference: insurance for catastrophic cyber incidents, and whether some kind of federal insurance response – such as a potential government partnership with the commercial cyber insurance market – is warranted.   Treasury’s research, analysis, and engagements with stakeholders in this area over the past year and a half have suggested a few preliminary observations, which I think we’ve heard echoed in the discussions today.One such observation is that catastrophic cyber risk appears to be different from attritional cyber risk in at least some significant respects, at least for now.  As you’ve heard today, while cyber insurance is a growing and evolving market, insuring for catastrophic cyber risks presents distinct challenges that need to be addressed.  Unlike for natural catastrophes, there is only limited historical data on systemic cyber incidents causing catastrophic losses with which to model actuarial projections, despite the rapidly increasing interconnectedness of our digital and networked world.  Risk evaluation for cyber is further complicated in that cyber risks can cascade across geographic and commercial boundaries.  This limits the ability of insurers and reinsurers to use traditional risk transfer strategies focusing on the region, industry, or size of the entity insured, and thereby requires the reevaluation of underwriting and risk management strategies to account for such differing accumulation risks.  Although the quality of cyber models is improving, they still have a long way to go, and they remain particularly assumption-dependent and may produce divergent results, particularly with respect to tail scenarios.  This uncertainty has increasingly led the sector to manage its exposure through tighter wording and broader exclusions and has also contributed to the reluctance of capital providers to provide greater capacity to the market.Even so, one might ask, why is it necessary to decide whether some kind of federal insurance response is warranted now?  In his remarks at the beginning of this event, Director Seitz described some of the origins of this inquiry, including language included in the 2019 reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, and a June 2022 Government Accountability Office report that concluded with a recommendation that FIO and CISA conduct a joint assessment of whether a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted, which recommendation Treasury and DHS accepted, leading to FIO’s Request For Information about a Potential Federal Insurance Response to Catastrophic Cyber Incidents last fall.  As you heard earlier from Deputy National Cyber Director Dudley, Treasury’s work in this area was highlighted in the Biden Administration’s National Cybersecurity Strategy released in March of this year.  Specifically, strategic objective 3.6 of the Strategy states: [quote] “The Administration will assess the need for and possible structures of a Federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber events that would support the existing cyber insurance market.” [end quote]. This objective appears in pillar three of the strategy, which is to “Shape market forces to drive security and resilience.”  The framing of the objective to assess the need for a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents as part of the National Cybersecurity Strategy’s overall emphasis on strengthening national resilience underlines a second observation that Treasury’s work on catastrophic cyber risk has suggested, and an answer to the question raised earlier, why now: the broad benefits for resilience and market certainty of advance planning for the economic impact of a catastrophic cyber incident.  This is a point that many of you in this room appreciate and have identified yourselves.  It is also an issue that our team has dealt with while assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on insurance markets and the potential policy responses in 2020.  In short, waiting until after a catastrophic cyber incident occurs is sub-optimal for everyone, including private sector firms, the government that bears the responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and ultimately the taxpayers.  While none of the recent events that I noted earlier have resulted in catastrophic cyber incidents, they are increasing in their frequency and impact.  Indeed, it may be a matter of when—not if—we experience a catastrophic cyber event.  As the National Cybersecurity Strategy puts it, “Structuring [a response to a catastrophic cyber incident] before a catastrophic event occurs—rather than rushing to develop an aid package after the fact—could provide certainty to markets and make the nation more resilient.”It is worth noting here that in its discussion of cyber insurance, the National Cybersecurity Strategy uses the term “resilience” with respect to the U.S. economy as a whole – as distinct from the narrower context of the resilience of the insurance industry alone.  I believe this is a distinction that has also been made during today’s discussion.As you have heard from my government colleagues earlier today, following its release of the National Cybersecurity Strategy, in July of this year the Administration published the Implementation Plan for the Strategy providing additional guidance to Treasury on next steps.  The Implementation Plan reaffirms that Treasury—specifically FIO—is the agency responsible for answering the threshold question of whether some form of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents is warranted and sets forth the end of this year as the target date for when the Administration will answer this question through our assessment.  It has been a busy year and a half since we initiated our assessment of catastrophic cyber risk and insurance.  Thus far, our initial focus has been on the threshold question of whether the risks from catastrophic cyber incidents warrant some kind of a federal insurance response.  As summarized earlier by Director Seitz, we received a great deal of substantive and useful feedback to our RFI from a broad cross-section of stakeholders.  In addition, we have benefited from both extensive industry meetings and internal research on the subject.  Today’s conference is an important part of our engagement effort.  The panel discussions have helped us to gain further insights from the perspectives of industry parties on the important policy issues presented by catastrophic cyber risk and a potential federal response.The National Cybersecurity Strategy and its Implementation Plan have charged us with answering a straightforward question about this complex issue: Is some kind of federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber incidents warranted?  This is the main issue that we are seeking to answer right now.  We’re fortunate to have learned a lot from these conversations today.  We need more of these types of conversations with the industry and other stakeholders going forward.Based upon the work that we have done and the discussions we’ve had to date, the final answer looks less like a straightforward “yes” or “no” than a more nuanced “it depends.” As today’s event has highlighted, a well-designed federal insurance response could address the risks of tail events while incentivizing healthy private sector practices.  Conversely, a poorly designed program could shift too much risk to the government and reduce firms’ incentives to guard against certain forms of low probability, but nonetheless foreseeable, risks. As for the immediate threshold question, however, we believe that further exploration of the proper federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk is warranted and should be undertaken.  And while much more work – and much more consultation – will need to take place about what form such a federal insurance response and/or such a public-private partnership should take, our work thus far has positioned us to reach at least one tentative conclusion regarding the scope of our focus, and to announce one concrete plan for our work in this area in 2024. The conclusion regarding scope is that because we see that the private market for insurance against attritional cyber risk from losses other than those related to major catastrophes is dynamic and growing, we anticipate that our assessment of a potential federal insurance response will remain sharply focused on catastrophic cyber risk.  And when assessing the insurance market for catastrophic cyber risk, we will remain focused on the policy options for some kind of public-private sector collaboration or other federal response that cabins catastrophic cyber risk alongside the existing and expanding commercial cyber insurance market. I am also pleased to announce here that, in conjunction with Treasury hosting next year’s International Forum of Terrorism Risk (Re)Insurance Pools, or IFTRIP, Annual Conference in Washington, DC in April 2024 that I mentioned earlier, Treasury will host an additional conference during the week of April 22 exploring in more detail some specific ideas about what form such a federal insurance response to catastrophic cyber risk, and/or a public-private partnership or other collaborative mechanism, might take. This conference, which FIO will organize, will naturally draw on the expertise of industry and other cyber insurance stakeholders, and will, in effect, serve as the follow-on to today’s event. Furthermore, preparations for this April conference will help structure FIO’s upcoming engagements with industry on this subject leading up to the conference, which could involve the organizing of one or more informal groups of subject matter experts and key stakeholders on specific topics relating to catastrophic cyber insurance.  FIO plans to take further actions along these lines after the new year. In the meantime, I look forward to seeing many of you at the subsequent event on catastrophic cyber insurance in April.In closing, let me say that it is clear that there is a great deal of interest in, and a significant number of complex questions about, this important issue.  I expect that many of you in this room will play an important role in helping to work through those questions in discussions with our FIO team.I want to again extend my and Treasury’s thanks to our co-sponsor, Dick Berner and NYU’s Volatility and Risk Institute; to all of our excellent speakers today; and to all of you in the audience for coming.  We at Treasury look forward to continuing to work further with you all on the important issue of insurance for catastrophic cyber risk in the future."
389,,"November 16, 2023","Good morning and thank you all for being here today. I’ve been looking forward to this annual conference and the opportunity for official sector representatives, academics, and market practitioners to come together.  As I said last year, an important mission for us collectively is to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market.  Accordingly, my remarks this morning will consist of two parts: first, a review of Treasury market conditions and liquidity this past year, and second, a brief discussion of progress made by the Inter-Agency Working Group on Treasury Market Surveillance (IAWG), with a focus on a few workstreams led by Treasury.As this audience is well aware, it has been an eventful year for the Treasury market and interest rate volatility has been high.  Against an economic backdrop of a strong labor market and higher-than-desired inflation, interest rates have continued to rise sharply.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) increased the target range for the federal funds rate to 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, and the 10-year Treasury yield touched 5 percent last month.  The interest rate increases have been punctuated by financial sector stresses and geopolitical risks that have emerged in the interim, and as shown in Figure 1, volatility measures for Treasury yields have been elevated and variable.  Implied volatility for the 2-year Treasury rose sharply last year around the beginning of the monetary policy tightening cycle, and spiked to an extreme level in March 2023, following the failures of SVB and Signature Bank, as investors revised sharply downward their expected path for monetary policy. Treasury market liquidity conditions have nevertheless remained orderly.   Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the relationship between the implied volatility for rates and market liquidity, measured by our composite index of trading conditions, for 2-year and 10-year Treasury securities.   Implied volatility for 2-year Treasury yields in 2022 and 2023 has been much higher than in 2019 to 2021, and when it reached extreme levels during the bank turmoil in March this year, market liquidity conditions deteriorated. While we would like to study this relationship more, market liquidity measures are not too far out of line with what a regression line would predict for the very high levels of volatility.1  For the 10-year nominal Treasury, the increase in volatility has not been as sizable, and liquidity metrics for 2023 have largely remained similar to last year, and clearly are significantly lower than in 2020 at similar levels for volatility. At the same time, as can be seen in Figure 4, transaction volumes reached new record highs in mid-March.  This combination of large transaction volumes (including for the two-year Treasury) and elevated volatility suggests that the market was able to facilitate significant risk transfer during this turbulent episode.  We conclude that market conditions have been orderly: High volatility has affected market liquidity conditions, as is typically the case, while reduced liquidity did not amplify volatility. Moreover, as shown in Figure 5, principal trading firms (PTFs) increased their activity in the Treasury market in March, providing a greater share of liquidity during this period of significant market stress.  This surge stands in contrast to the decline in the PTF share in March 2020.  The different reactions of PTFs to the events of 2023 and 2020 could be a subject for future study, but the higher share is more consistent with past behavior, such as during the October 15, 2014 event, which, you may know, prompted the official sector to organize this conference more than 8 years ago. Moving on from this period, downside risks from the banking stresses began to recede, and after the debt ceiling was lifted, Treasury rapidly issued bills to rebuild its cash balance.2 Ten-year Treasury yields rose, initially more gradually than shorter-term rates, but then sharply, by nearly 100 basis points between July and the end of October.  The sharp increase suggests a notable rise in term premiums, the compensation that investors require for holding longer-maturity debt, which is, estimated generally to have been persistently negative for many years.   There are a range of explanations that we have heard for the estimated rise in the term premium, including from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) a few weeks ago.  Some have suggested that the expected path of short rates is higher than what is assumed in term premium models, as the resilience of the economy in the face of rate hikes has resulted in an upward revision to the long-run neutral rate of interest, or r*.   Greater volatility in macroeconomic data may also contribute to investors needing more compensation for risk. Others highlight the shift towards more price-sensitive investors as the marginal source of Treasury demand, with the Federal Reserve reducing and foreign reserve managers at the very least not adding to their positions in Treasury securities.  We’ve seen lower levels of demand from commercial banks, as well. Adding to this dynamic are growing estimates of Treasury’s borrowing needs from the private sector, because of higher projected fiscal deficits or the Fed’s quantitative tightening lasting longer than expected.  In addition, we’ve heard that the correlation of stocks and bonds turning positive may be a contributing factor, as market participants may view Treasury securities as providing a less effective hedge for risky assets when the nature of shocks to the economy changes from predominantly demand shocks to supply shocks. While there are many possible reasons, the rise in term premiums on sovereign debt does not appear to be unique to the US or to this narrow time period, so the most plausible explanations should have some cross-country commonalities.  Moreover, it is worth emphasizing again that the recent increases in term premiums and volatility do not appear to be because of technical market functioning issues; rather liquidity conditions have held up well. Finally, at the most recent quarterly refunding, amid elevated volatility, we decided to moderate the rate of increase in longer-dated coupon auction sizes, an action which was broadly aligned with the expectations of the primary dealers and with the recommendations of the TBAC.   As always, we strive to finance the government at the least cost over time, and our borrowing decisions are made within the context of our regular and predictable issuance framework.  This framework considers a range of factors, including an assessment of demand at points across the curve. In the past week, we’ve been monitoring a cybersecurity incident at the U.S. broker dealer sub of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which provides clearing services for Treasury securities transactions.  Treasury activated its cyber incident response procedures, which includes a sector-wide executive response group.  The firm quickly moved to alternative processing, and the event did not spread to other firms nor have a notable effect on Treasury markets.  We are staying in regular contact with key financial sector participants and federal regulators, as well as continuing to assess potential effects on Treasury markets. While we’ve seen that Treasury market liquidity has held up well over the past year even amid very high volatility, we have, and should have, a very low tolerance for any significant disruptions to this market. The IAWG members have continued to work on a number of significant reforms to enhance the resilience of the Treasury market and, last week, released a third Staff Progress Report.3  Some potential reforms are complex and could have wide-ranging effects.  Accordingly, we recognize that it is important that the IAWG members work carefully, with substantial public input, and that we attempt to coordinate initiatives in pursuit of our common purpose.  I will speak to a few initiatives that Treasury is leading and leave the discussion of other initiatives to my IAWG colleagues. I will start with an update on transparency for Treasury securities.  When I spoke at this conference last year, I stated that we sought to expand transparency in a gradual and calibrated way.  I said we would “walk, not run.”  And in the past year, we’ve been walking steadily down this path and have made important progress.  First, in February 2023, FINRA, in consultation with Treasury, replaced the weekly reports on secondary market trading with daily reports.  These reports also provide more information on trade counts and volume-weighted average prices for on-the-run nominal coupon securities.  We’ve received positive feedback from market participants about the reports.  By coincidence, this greater transparency was available just weeks before the regional banking stresses I mentioned earlier, allowing market participants to benefit from the enhanced information about Treasury securities market activity during that difficult time. Second, we have made progress towards the public release of detailed secondary market transaction data for on-the-run nominal coupons, with end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes.  During the past year, we have worked with FINRA to improve the transactions reporting processes and turn this proposed policy into a reality. Market participants have noted that capping the size of a trade in disseminated data would provide some protection for counterparties, while still indicating to others that a large trade had occurred. This practice is used in disseminating data in other fixed income markets.  Market participants have generally suggested that caps should be simple and easy to understand, calibrated for differences in liquidity and interest rate risk across tenors, and that they should be re-evaluated periodically.  There has also been interest in releasing an “uncapped” data set with true trade sizes, but only months after execution to avoid any disruption to liquidity provision. Two weeks ago, FINRA submitted their proposed rule filing to the SEC to move forward with transaction-level dissemination as described.  We are hopeful that, after a review of the public comments, the SEC will approve a final rule and the proposed dissemination by FINRA for on-the-runs can begin soon afterwards.  In line with our “walk, not run” policy, once we have had time to evaluate the effects of disseminating on-the-run transactions, we’ll consider possible next steps for additional transparency. Continuing on improving data quality and availability, in January 2023, Treasury’s Office of Financial Research (OFR) proposed a rule to establish ongoing collection of data from the non-centrally cleared bilateral repo market, where transactions are conducted between two firms without a central counterparty.  This market represents one of the largest remaining data gaps for the official sector on Treasury market activity.  Filling this gap will provide data on primary dealers’ counterparties, including hedge funds, and the terms of the trades, which should help to be able to assess the vulnerabilities in the market.  Specifically, the proposed rule would cover U.S. financial companies with an average of $10 billion or more in daily outstanding commitments to borrow cash and extend guarantees through non-centrally cleared bilateral repo contracts. This threshold would include both overnight and intraday commitments.  The OFR currently is considering comments received from the public and expects to publish a final rule in early 2024.Another workstream is to monitor and assess the effects of leverage and liquidity risk mismatches to reduce possible fire-sale dynamics in Treasury markets if funds were to have to meet margin calls or investor redemptions.  For example, we continue to highlight the need for funds to adopt anti-dilution tools to reduce the first-mover advantage in open-end funds that hold less-liquid assets. Additionally, the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s interagency Hedge Fund Working Group has been analyzing trends in leverage and potential funding vulnerabilities in non-centrally cleared bilateral Treasury repo transactions, building on the pilot data collection for this market.We are aware of the increasing amount of attention being shown to Treasury cash-futures basis positions, in which hedge funds take a short position in Treasury futures, and an offsetting long position in cash Treasury securities financed by repo. CFTC data indicate that the gross volumes of futures have grown substantially over the past 18 months, with long positions in Treasury futures by asset managers and short positions by hedge funds.  Repo market activity (particularly sponsored) has also picked up, some of which could be related to financing Treasury securities as part of cash-futures basis positions.  This basis activity could provide benefits by increasing the liquidity of Treasury securities, improving integration between related cash and derivative market segments, and translating demand for futures into demand for Treasury securities.  At the same time, we are attentive to the potential risks of a disorderly unwind of leveraged positions, especially those reliant on rolling over financing every day.  Naturally, we are monitoring these developments closely, because of its potential financial stability risks, and also because of its potential effects on Treasury market liquidity and demand for Treasury securities. Finally, I would like to address Treasury buybacks, which we announced at the May 2023 refunding for anticipated implementation next year.  Based on extensive consultations with a broad variety of market participants, we believe that buybacks can play an important role in making the Treasury market more resilient by supporting market liquidity, while also enhancing our cash management capabilities.  I’d like to highlight some key takeaways from our analysis here.4First, our intention is to conduct buybacks in a regular and predictable manner, cycling through each of our maturity buckets at least once per quarter for liquidity support.  While cash management operations will be more episodic, their timing will nevertheless be predictable because they will be focused during periods of high cash inflows such as around major tax filing dates.Second, Treasury intends to be price sensitive in evaluating which buyback offers to accept.  We don’t have an objective to purchase a certain quantity of securities. As a result, the amount we buy in any given operation might be materially lower than the maximum amount that we announce we’re willing to buy.  As a reminder, we’ve noted our intention to initially purchase as much as $30 billion per quarter in liquidity support operations, and up to $120 billion per year for cash management.     Third, we believe that liquidity support buybacks should improve the willingness of investors and intermediaries to trade and provide liquidity in these securities, all else equal, through the knowledge that there is a potential outlet to sell some of their off-the-run holdings.  These operations can make intermediation capacity more readily available, as we buy back hard-to-move securities that are in broker-dealer inventories and would otherwise absorb their intermediation capacity.  However, given the caps on buyback amounts, our purchases would not be a substitute for actions that could be taken by the Federal Reserve during periods of acute market stress.Treasury will continue to refine its operational design for buybacks, and we intend to provide an update on timing in the next quarterly refunding announcement on January 31.To conclude, despite the various shocks and stresses that emerged during this year, Treasury market functioning has been orderly.  The IAWG members have made progress on a number of reforms laid out in the staff reports, but there is still more to complete.  I am confident that the IAWG members working with one another, and with market participants, such as those in this room, and other interested parties, can make additional significant progress in the coming year.  Efforts to continue strengthening Treasury market resilience will serve us well over the years to come.  Thank you.1.

Soon after the March bank failures, the Treasury market also dealt with the consequences of the debt limit impasse.  The eventual rebuild of the Treasury General Account (TGA) from a low of $23 billion in early-June to more than $550 billion in mid-July was absorbed by the market in stride.  Importantly, the increase in Treasury bill issuance that funded the increased TGA balances led to reduced participation in the Federal Reserve’s overnight reverse repo facility, rather than adding further stress to bank deposits.3.

390,,"March 11, 2021","WASHINGTON – Today, President Biden announced his intention to nominate several key roles at the United States Department of the Treasury. The individuals he intends to nominate include:“With the passage of the American Rescue Plan yesterday, Americans are counting on our Treasury team to do all they can to accelerate the recovery. These nominees are key to that effort,” said Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen. “They have devoted their careers to the work of strengthening the American economy and have done it with integrity. Given their extensive qualifications, I look forward to their confirmations.”"
391,,"February 5, 2021","Today, Secretary Yellen spoke at a virtual roundtable with Vice President Kamala D Harris and participants from local Black Chambers of Commerce from across the country to discuss the importance of passing the American Rescue Plan.Thank you all for joining us. I know the members of the Black Chambers of Commerce have been very engaged in helping us respond to this economic crisis, and I am looking forward to our conversation.It was probably because I started studying economics during the Civil Rights Movement. I took my first course around 1963. I was a freshman in college. And if you looked at the economic data back then, the average Black family possessed roughly 15% the wealth of the average white family.Today, African Americans remain unemployed at roughly twice the rate of white Americans. And that number hasn’t really changed in fifty years either. It’s as close to a constant as you come in economic data.Indeed, if you somehow transported my freshman economics professor to 2021 – and you only showed him the employment and the wealth numbers – he would have a hard time guessing that the country has passed the Civil Rights Act… or that we’d elected our first Black president… or our first Black Vice President.Instead, he might actually notice signs that the country had headed in the opposite direction – especially after 2008. During the last recession, the highest white unemployment ever reached was 9.2%. But black unemployment was trapped above 10% for five years. And it peaked earlier and recovered slower than unemployment for almost any other group.This is what economic crises do. They hit people of color harder and longer. They push our country away from our values, towards more inequality. And I am worried the current crisis will do this again.During the early days of the pandemic, African Americans were the first to lose their small businesses. They were the first to lose their jobs. And we’ve seen early data that suggest Black workers will be the last re-hired when the economy opens back up.This is why the American Rescue Plan is badly needed: To make sure that this pandemic isn’t another generational setback for racial equality. And better yet, to finally start building an economy that works for everyone.When she swore me in as Secretary, we spoke, and she asked me about providing more capital to Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions.These CDFIs and MDIs are so important because they serve communities that the wider financial system traditionally hasn’t served well – especially communities of color. They give loans to people to buy homes and start businesses."
392,,"February 2, 2021","Last year, the economy shrunk more than any other since the end of World War II. With the growth that the CBO projects, it will be years before the country reaches full employment again.Then there are the more immediate concerns: Can we get the vaccine distributed quickly? Will people keep a roof over their heads? Will their unemployment benefits last until the end of the crisis? Will families go hungry? Will small businesses survive?All this is why we’re proposing the American Rescue Plan: So Americans can make it to the other side of this crisis and be met there by a strong, growing economy."
393,,"December 14, 2020","WASHINGTON – U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement on the rescission of Sudan’s State Sponsor of Terrorism designation:
 “The rescission of Sudan from the State Sponsor of Terrorism list today opens a new chapter in relations between the United States and Sudan.  We commend the efforts of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok’s transition government, the Sovereign Council, as well as the people of Sudan, in taking the bold steps leading to today’s actions. 
“We also note the ongoing and difficult economic and governance reforms that the transitional government is pursuing in order to create a stable, growing economy that provides opportunities for all Sudanese to share in the country’s economic potential. 
“The United States Treasury looks forward to working with bipartisan members of Congress, and with Sudan to help clear its arrears at the International Financial Institutions and to advance Sudan’s efforts to secure debt relief in 2021.”"
394,,"December 10, 2020","Senator Toomey, Representative Hill, Representative Shalala, and Commissioner Ramamurti, I am pleased to join you today to discuss the Department of the Treasury’s work to execute the National Security Loan Program established in the CARES Act. Treasury has worked diligently to implement every piece of the CARES Act, including the National Security Loan Program, efficiently and transparently. The CARES Act provides funding for up to $17 billion in loans to businesses critical to maintaining national security related to losses incurred as a result of coronavirus. The CARES Act authorized Treasury to make loans and loan guarantees for “businesses critical to maintaining national security.” The statute, however, does not define that term. Therefore, after consulting with the Department of Defense and the Office of Director of National Intelligence, Treasury issued guidance on April 10, 2020, providing that a company can fall within this definition if it meets at least one of three criteria: 
If a company met at least one of the three necessary criteria, Treasury conducted detailed financial and legal reviews of each application pursuant to consistent credit standards that were applied to all applicants. 
To date, Treasury has approved 11 loans totaling nearly $736 million. Information on the companies and dollar amounts are publicly available on our website, Treasury.gov.
Many of the companies we initially expected to take part in the program were able to raise funds in the capital markets, leaving most of the available loan funds unused. Going forward, I urge Congress to re-allocate these funds to provide relief for aviation industry workers, who continue to struggle through no fault of their own. I would like to thank the members of the Commission for working with us to provide vital economic relief to American workers, families, and businesses. I hope that the extensive amount of information Treasury has provided to the Commission has been helpful to you, and I am pleased to answer any questions you may have.
 "
395,,"December 1, 2020","Chairwoman Waters, Ranking Member McHenry, and members of the Committee, I am pleased to join you today to discuss the Department of the Treasury’s unprecedented response to support the American people throughout the coronavirus pandemic. We continue to work to implement the historic CARES Act with speed, efficiency, and transparency, but our job will not be complete until we get every American back to work.When I last testified before you in September, I stated that America is in the midst of the fastest economic recovery from any crisis in U.S. history. I am proud to say that while there is more work to be done, that statement is even more true today. In the third quarter, GDP grew by 33.1% at an annual rate, beating all expectations and nearly doubling the previous record set in 1950. Americans are getting back to work. The October jobs report showed that the economy has gained back 12.1 million jobs since April—more than 50% of all jobs lost due to the pandemic. The private service-providing sector, which includes those industries that were most impacted by the initial economic shutdowns, has regained 58% of the jobs lost. The unemployment rate has decreased to 6.9%, a rate not expected by Blue Chip to be achieved until the fourth quarter of 2021. The historic, bipartisan CARES Act provided the economic relief critical to supporting our robust recovery. Additional economic shutdowns, however, continue to impair this remarkable progress and cause great harm to American businesses and workers.Based on recent economic data, I continue to believe that a targeted fiscal package is the most appropriate federal response. I strongly encourage Congress to use the $455 billion in unused funds from the CARES Act to pass an additional bill with bipartisan support. The Administration is standing ready to support Congress in this effort to help American workers and small businesses that continue to struggle with the impact of COVID-19. Treasury has been working hard to implement the CARES Act in a transparent and efficient manner. We have released a significant amount of information to the public on our website, Treasury.gov, and on USAspending.gov. In many instances, we have released more information than what is required by the statute. We continue to cooperate with various oversight bodies, including the new Special Inspector General for Pandemic Relief, the Treasury Inspector General, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the new Congressional Oversight Commission, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO).We have provided regular updates to Congress, with this marking my ninth appearance before Congress for a CARES Act hearing. We have also devoted significant resources to responding to inquiries from numerous congressional committees and individual Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.  We appreciate your interest in these issues, and we remain committed to working with you to accommodate Congress’s legislative requests and to further advance our whole-of-government approach to defeating COVID-19.I would like to thank the members of the Committee for working with us to provide critical economic relief to the American people. I am pleased to answer any questions you may have.

396,,"November 30, 2020","Good evening. It is my distinct honor to be here to commemorate the signing of the historic Abraham Accords. This landmark agreement between the United Arab Emirates and Israel, and Israel and the Kingdom of Bahrain marks the first step in over twenty-five years towards a more peaceful, secure, and prosperous Middle East. I am honored to represent President Trump at this momentous occasion.The Peace Treaties are named the Abraham Accords for the important place the Abraham played in the history of Judaism, Christianity, and the Islam religions. Abraham (flourished early 2nd millennium BCE), the first of the patriarchs and a figure revered by the three great monotheistic religions—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. According to the biblical book of Genesis, Abraham left Ur, in Mesopotamia, because God called him to found a new nation. In Judaism the promised offspring is understood to be the Jewish people descended from Abraham’s son, Isaac, born of his wife Sarah. Similarly, in Christianity the genealogy of Jesus is traced to Isaac, and Abraham’s near-sacrifice of Isaac is seen as a foreshadowing of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross. In Islam it is Ishmael, Abraham’s firstborn son, born of Hagar, who is viewed as the fulfillment of God’s promise, and the Prophet Muhammad is his descendant.The fact that we are all here together in Abu Dhabi demonstrates the importance of this occasion. I’d like to offer our thanks to His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, His Highness Sheikh Tahnoun Bin Zayed, His Highness Sheikh Hamed bin Zayed, Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al-Qasimi, Minister Al-Tayer, Minister Al-Jaber, H.E. Khaldoun Al-Mubarak, Chairman Mohamed Khalifa Al-Mubarak, Minister Al-Kaabi and all of the Emiratis for their gracious hospitality.First, I’d like to thank Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for taking the extraordinary step for the betterment of their nations, the region, and the world. Because of their courageous leadership, I firmly believe more Middle Eastern nations will follow your lead and sign onto this agreement, as Bahrain has already done and as other countries have expressed interest in doing.Second, I’d like to thank President Trump for his bold leadership and for making the strategic decision to focus on what brings these two nations together, as opposed to what has historically driven them apart.Also from the United States, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner, and National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien, who have all played a crucial role in achieving this agreement. I would also like to thank members of the U.S. delegation with us tonight: Ambassador Rikolta, Avi Berkowitz, Adam Boehler, Robert Greenway, and Major General Correa.The first step toward peace in the region came in September 1978 with the signing of the Camp David Accords signed by Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. This was followed with the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty signed in 1979. The Treaty made significant strides to enhance the security of both nations by ending decades of war, demilitarizing the Sinai Peninsula, and allowing Israeli ships to freely pass through the Suez Canal, among other steps to normalize relations. It also historically made Egypt the first Arab nation to officially recognize the state of Israel.This treaty was made in part thanks to President Carter’s leadership. Following his election to office, he reinvigorated the peace process and persisted through 14 months of diplomatic negotiations. These negotiations culminated after twelve days of secret meetings at Camp David.The Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty began with the signing of the Washington Declaration in Washington, DC and was presided over by President Clinton. The Declaration ended a long and tragic war. In his speech marking the historic occasion, President Clinton acknowledged the courage of the Jordanian leader, King Hussein. The leaders then, put aside their differences and compromised to reach agreements that have been central to enhancing peace and security throughout the region. The Israel- Jordan Peace Treaty settled relations between the two countries, adjusted water and land disputes, border crossings, passports, and other importance matters.The Abraham Accords signed by the UAE and Israel built and improved upon these agreements by transforming the regional security environment, as well as driving economic prosperity for all nations involved.With no movement towards peace in more than 25 years, President Trump recognized a new approach was needed, took action, and decided to focus negotiations on the parties’ mutual desire to create opportunity, inspire innovation, and increase prosperity for their people. This focus on improving economic relations created a historic breakthrough that will reshape the Middle East for decades to come.Recognizing this strategic opportunity for change and improvement, His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and Prime Minister Netanyahu made the bold and courageous decision to focus on their shared interests and choose a better future for their citizens.With the signing of the Abraham Accords, the UAE and Israel have started a new chapter in their nations’ history. They have committed to opening embassies and appointing ambassadors, which will significantly help further their strategic relationship by increasing dialogue and cooperation. They have also begun meeting to establish bilateral agreements on investment, tourism, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, and other areas of mutual interest.While much has been deservedly written on the diplomatic and geo-political importance of the United Arab Emirates and Israel signing the Abraham Accords, I’d like to focus on what is conceivably more important for the people of Israel and the Gulf – the economic opportunities and the security improvements that can be created from these new partnerships.The Abraham Accords establish direct economic ties between two of the Middle East’s most thriving and advanced economies. These ties create a tremendous foundation for economic growth, and it is now our job to turn the Accords’ vision for growth and opportunity into actual innovation and prosperity.Israel and UAE each have close to the same population at 9-10 Million people and similar size economies at approximately 400 Billion GDP. Yet the constructs of the economies are different and now they are now unleashed to grow faster together through shared investment and trade. Together, Emirati and Israeli businesses, along with their U.S. partners, can restore the commercial bonds that flourished centuries ago. Israelis, with their world-class technology and innovation, can help their Emirati counterparts diversify their economy, better manage scarce water resources and launch innovative new IT platforms. Emirati expertise in ports and logistics, energy, and world-class tourism can likewise bring new growth opportunities to Israel.Israel and the UAE also have the financial ability and expertise together to take advantage of opportunities elsewhere in the world. This will demonstrate not only the value of this partnership, but also the values that the UAE and Israel share. While many choose to focus on the existing differences and challenges, Emirati and Israeli citizens share many interests, and your businesses and people are now primed to join forces to create more wealth, solve more problems, and develop next-generation innovations that benefit both your countries and the world. An immediate example of this was the decision to cooperate on the treatment of and development of a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has the potential to save millions of lives throughout the region. I am confident that additional areas for cooperation and partnership will be identified, and the United States is eager to work with you both.With greater economic prosperity comes stronger security. Along with the United States, Israel and the UAE share a similar outlook regarding the threats and opportunities in the region, as well as a shared commitment to promoting stability through diplomatic engagement, increased economic integration, and closer security coordination. Today’s agreement will lead to better lives for the peoples of the United Arab Emirates, Israel, and the region.Together, the UAE and Israel will stand better prepared to confront malign threats from the Iranian regime, their proxies, and other extremist groups. The United States has long supported both Israel and the UAE in their defense in the region, and with this agreement, we can all stand united against the Iranian regime’s malign influence.Emiratis and Israelis can deploy the technology and expertise to stop bad actors intent on stealing secrets, funding terrorist attacks, or attacking the infrastructure and systems that are critical to the health of our economies. This historic partnership will make both the Gulf and the Levant stronger and safer. On this foundation, Emiratis and Israelis will both prosper, leaving their citizens a safer and better world.The discussions we have had today and in the coming weeks and months will bear witness to how well we take advantage of this unique and historic opportunity. I encourage you to find the common and shared values and to build the economic relationships that will shape your nations for generations to come.Other Middle Eastern nations will see the extraordinary benefits of this agreement and join you and Bahrain, on your journey to more peaceful, secure and prosperous futures. The Abraham Accords is only the first critical step in President Trump’s vision for finding comprehexnsive stability in the region.There is a story in the Bible of Bezalel. He was chosen by Moses to be the Chief Artisan of the Tabernacle which was which was considered a very important job as it was the Tent of the Congregation. Moses had been instructed at Mount Sinai to have it built. Bezazel was chosen by Moses as he was known as a highly gifted workman, showing great skill and originality. He was also known to have both Wisdom (Chochma) and Heart (Lev). His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed and Prime Minister Netanyahu through their bold and courageous leadership have shown wisdom and heart.I thank you for the tremendous opportunity to be part of this historic occasion and for the opportunity to speak tonight. I am eager to continue to working with the UAE and Israel to find ways to grow this newfound economic relationship. These remarks have been revised post-delivery to include reference to the 1994 peace agreement between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, forged between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein.These remarks have been revised post-delivery to include reference to the 1994 peace agreement between the State of Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, forged between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Jordan's King Hussein."
397,,"October 29, 2020","WASHINGTON – U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin issued the following statement regarding offsets applied by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to payments due to the Fire Department of New York (FDNY): “For over a decade, the FDNY has been forced to shoulder the burden of debts owed by the NYC government. Since this issue was brought to my attention, I have been personally engaged in ensuring that New York’s Bravest receive everything that they are due from the U.S. government.“The firefighters who answered the call of duty in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 deserve the nation’s total support. I am delighted that CMS has wired payments to the FDNY refunding the past offsets applied to cover unpaid NYC debts. I am also pleased that this issue has been successfully resolved, and that World Trade Center Health Program payments are now protected from future offsets.”"
398,,"October 14, 2020","WASHINGTON – As we begin the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, we find ourselves seven months into a global economic and health crisis unlike any the world has previously faced. Since March, the World Bank and IMF have helped countries respond quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic, adapting their operations to provide urgently needed emergency finance and advice to over 130 countries. As countries continue to respond to the crisis and move toward recovery, the IMF and World Bank will remain instrumental players, helping countries restore economic stability and lay the groundwork for a robust medium-term recovery characterized by sustainable growth and debt accumulation.The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis that requires a global response. The United States is doing its part, deploying the largest economic relief package in American history. The U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act provided a tremendous boost, leading to vigorous rebounds across the economy.  Since April, the United States has experienced the fastest labor market recovery on record, regaining 11.4 million jobs in just five months. We also see signs of a strengthening economic recovery across U.S. industries, with retail sales at an all-time high, manufacturing on a positive trend since this summer, and home sales and core capital goods orders exceeding pre-pandemic levels. The strength and comprehensiveness of the recovery speaks to the size and breadth of fiscal and monetary support, as well as to the speed with which that support has been implemented.  While we are pleased with the success of the CARES Act, there is more work to be done and we will continue to work to support the recovery.The extraordinary fiscal and monetary response unleashed by most major economies has helped cushion the pandemic’s terrible economic impact. Global financial conditions have eased significantly from the height of market turmoil in the spring, and economic data is trending positive in most economies. At the same time, we encourage our international partners not to withdraw critical policy support prematurely, particularly given remaining uncertainty about the path of the pandemic and its economic effects. Rather, we believe they should calibrate their policy measures to current conditions so as to promote rapid and durable recovery. To that end, we support the work of the Financial Stability Board to coordinate efforts to sustain the supply of credit to the real economy, support financial intermediation, and preserve the functioning and resilience of the global financial system.The IMF and World Bank Group must continue to play a key role in assisting members through this crisis with advice, capacity development, and financing. We commend the IMF’s rapid expansion of financing to countries hard hit by the economic effects of the pandemic. As countries transition from crisis management toward recovery, the IMF will continue to play a key role by assisting countries in addressing near-term external imbalances while helping them establish credible, appropriately sequenced recovery and adjustment plans. For countries with more protracted adjustment needs, the IMF must encourage them to move from emergency financing towards full-fledged programs that incorporate necessary structural reforms to enable stronger recoveries. The IMF should continue to fully use its existing financing tools, though some additional flexibility in the design of conditionality may be warranted. In a number of countries, debtors and creditors will need to work together expeditiously to restructure debt, in particular to unlock much-needed IMF financing. We support the IMF’s provision of debt service relief to hard-hit low-income countries through the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT). We urge IMF management to continue updating the Executive Board on the adequacy of resources, and we stress the importance of implementing the expanded New Arrangements to Borrow and changes to bilateral borrowing arrangements on schedule.Even as the IMF deploys its resources towards crisis response, it must also remain focused on delivering on its core mandate of global economic and financial stability. In this context, we look forward to the prompt resumption of bilateral surveillance to provide much-needed policy advice. Simultaneously, we stress the importance of the upcoming reviews of key policies, including the Comprehensive Surveillance Review and review of the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program. Rising public debt has reinforced the importance of the IMF’s agenda on debt sustainability and transparency, and debt issues should remain at the forefront of the IMF’s agenda. We also look forward to upcoming reviews of the IMF’s debt limits policy and the debt sustainability analysis tool for market access countries, both of which should underscore the importance of greater transparency of public debt data.The World Bank Group has moved swiftly to help recipient countries bolster their pandemic response and improve health systems to address the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable as countries strive to tackle the immediate challenges of COVID-19. World Bank implementation of the Multiphase Programmatic Approach has helped combat the spread and mitigate the effects of COVID-19 by providing developing countries with access to critically needed medical supplies while supporting the continued delivery of key services including education, health, social protection, and financial needs. International Finance Corporation assistance has enabled clients in the real and financial sectors directly affected by the pandemic to sustain operations and preserve jobs. As countries transition from crisis management to recovery, the World Bank Group will continue to play a key role in assisting countries to develop credible reform plans tosupport broad-based growth and job creation and to cultivate productive investments and opportunities for the private sector. It must do so while mitigating the economic impacts of the crisis on the poor and vulnerable, creating conditions to restore medium-term macroeconomic stability, and maintaining a focus on long-term development goals.The World Bank also plays a leadership role in its policy and accountability standards.  We stress the need for robust and independent accountability mechanisms to ensure that Bank Group projects remain strong and effective and have the intended positive impact. We also call on the World Bank to set the global standard for the policy on and procurement of resilient and secure information and communications technologies. As the World Bank Group moves forward in this regard, we ask that it pay due attention to cybersecurity and the use of trusted actors.During these challenging economic times, it is critical that the World Bank manage financial resources judiciously and transparently, with clear justifications for allocations to countries with robust access to other financing sources, so as not to burden shareholders with premature calls for new financing. This will require targeting resources where needs are highest, in line with the capital package commitments, and focusing on the Bank’s long-term development mission. We urge the World Bank Management to engage with the Executive Board on how to do so. Finally, we believe that no additional shareholding adjustments for the IBRD and IFC are required at this time, given the current context and the ongoing implementation of the shareholding adjustments through the 2018 capital package, and we support completing the shareholding reviews for both institutions at this time.As we move towards recovery, we encourage countries to see in this crisis an opportunity to improve debt management and pursue structural reforms that lay the foundation for stronger medium-term growth, economic resilience, and debt sustainability. We commend the role the IMF and World Bank have taken to support the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). We appreciate the work the World Bank and IMF have done to further debt transparency and public disclosure of debt data, as well as facilitate creditor and debtor debt data reconciliation. The DSSI has made significant progress since April, granting beneficiary countries needed fiscal space to respond to COVID-19, and we support the extension of this initiative, with full, prompt, and robust participation from all official bilateral creditors. Enhanced debt transparency is critical to shine light on irresponsible lending practices and lead to better-informed future financing decisions. Countries that receive DSSI support should disclose all public and publicly guaranteed debt, and we support efforts by the World Bank to increase the granularity of debt data reported in International Debt Statistics database.We also welcome the G20/Paris Club Common Framework for COVID-19 Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI. Guided by IMF programs and debt sustainability analyses, the Common Framework will facilitate debt write-downs when needed, help promote debt sustainability, and support policy reforms. Moreover, under the Framework, all official bilateral creditors will provide debt relief on common parameters, with equitable burden sharing that covers all private and official bilateral creditors. The Common Framework is an important measure to support low-income countries as they tackle the economic effects of the pandemic. We urge G20 members to quickly endorse the Framework to foster timely and orderly debt resolutions and provide low-income countries a clear path to tackle unsustainable debt burdens."

When COVID-19 forced President Trump to shut down the economy, we worked very quickly with the Senate and the House to pass unprecedented legislation to help the economy.  We are very proud that party politics was put aside and that the Senate passed two important bills 96-0 and 100-0.  The House also passed them with overwhelming bipartisan support and President Trump signed them into law.  This was truly an example of us working together to help American workers and businesses that were impacted by the pandemic.  As a result of this legislation, the economy rebounded quickly and we did not experience an economic disaster similar to the Great Depression.  Certain parts of the economy are still in need of additional support, and our job is not done until we get everyone back to work.

Over the last few months, we have tried to work on a bipartisan basis to pass additional legislation.  Our focus has been on passing legislation to provide funds for testing, vaccines, distribution, and medical care.  We have also focused on getting money for schools so children can go back to school safely or have the resources to study at home.  Our focus has been on small businesses, hotels, restaurants, airlines, and other industries that have been shut down or scaled back for no reason other than COVID-19.  We have proposed extending enhanced unemployment benefits and sending direct payments to American citizens.  We have added money for rental and mortgage assistance, child care, broadband, and agriculture support.
We have offered many different proposals in an effort to pass bipartisan legislation.  We have both been available to speak to members of both parties as well as bipartisan groups.  The President is available to meet as well.

The House has passed two separate partisan bills instead of compromising with us on bipartisan legislation like we have done in the past.  We will continue to try to work with Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer.  It is not just about the top-line number but also about legislation that can be passed by both the House and the Senate and signed into law by President Trump to help the American people.

Now is the time for us to come together and immediately vote on a bill to allow us to spend the unused Paycheck Protection Program funds while we continue to work toward a comprehensive package.  The all-or-nothing approach is an unacceptable response to the American people. "
